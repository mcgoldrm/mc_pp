PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31000CP 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 002 
Subject: Code of Ethics and Employee Conduct 

I. General 
A. The purpose of the Montgomery College Code of Ethics is to outline ethical 
standards for employees, acknowledge employees whose decisions and actions 
meet these standards, and hold accountable those employees who choose not to 
meet the standards. 
B. The Office of Compliance, Risk, and Ethics (“OCRE”) shall be responsible for 
recommending to the President and ensuring all College employees receive 
initial and periodic refresher training. 
II. Reporting Suspected Ethical Violations 
A. All employees are expected to report any suspected violations of College Policies 
and Procedures, including ethical violations. Employees are encouraged to 
contact their supervisor or manager with their ethical concerns or concerns about 
violation of policy or procedure. If contacting the supervisor is not possible or if 
an employee does not wish to report the concern to the supervisor, reporting may 
be made directly to the Chief Compliance, Risk, and Ethics Officer or to the 
confidential reporting line: 
Online Reporting: www.montgomerycollege.ethicspoint.com 
Toll-free Reporting Line: 1-844-572-2198 

OCRE will conduct an initial review of all reports received through the 
confidential reporting line and will triage those reports as set forth below. All 
reports are confidential, to the extent permitted by law. 

B. Where a reported violation is addressed specifically through the College’s 
existing policies and procedures, including grievance procedures, the office 
granted jurisdiction by that policy or procedure will investigate the report. Such 
reports fall outside the investigatory jurisdiction of OCRE. In these cases, 
OCRE will: 
1. forward the report to the office with jurisdiction, and 
2. track the report to ensure that the office with jurisdiction addresses 
the report and brings it to a timely resolution. 
When the investigation is complete, the responsible office will notify OCRE of 
the disposition. 

C. OCRE is authorized to investigate any suspected violation that does not fall 
within the express jurisdiction of another office, pursuant to College policies 
and procedures. OCRE endeavors to complete investigations in a timely 
fashion, with the goal of completing investigations within 60 days. 
III. Protection Against Retaliation 
Page 1 of 2 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31000CP 

There shall be no retaliation against individuals who, in good faith, report suspected 
ethical violations. Reports of suspected retaliation will follow Montgomery College 
Policy and Procedure 39003-Protection Against Retaliation. 

IV. Education 
Education is a key element of this Policy. The College will provide education and 
information, as appropriate, for employees to enhance understanding and increase 
awareness of the College’s Code of Ethics and Employee Conduct Policy and 
Procedure. The President is authorized to provide institutional leadership and guidance 
for developing education programs to increase knowledge and share information and 
resources to promote a strong ethical culture at the College. Some goals to be achieved 
through education are: (a) ensuring that all employees are aware of the College’s ethical 
standards; (b) deterring unethical conduct; and (c) identifying resources available for 
reporting concerns. Any mandatory education requirements will be announced and 
posted on the College’s website. 

Presidential Approval: June 30, 2017; June 18, 2019

POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 31001 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 006 
Subject: Sexual Misconduct 

I. Policy Statement 
It is the policy of Montgomery College to establish and maintain an environment in which 
all members of the Montgomery College community can work or participate in College 
education programs and activities free from all forms of sexual misconduct. Sexual 
misconduct is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX of the Education 
Amendments of 1972. In addition, some forms of sexual misconduct violate the criminal 
laws of the State of Maryland. Sexual misconduct in any form will not be tolerated by 
Montgomery College. The College will take immediate action to preserve and restore 
equal educational access when the College has actual knowledge of sexual misconduct. 

II. Definitions 
For purposes of this Policy, “sexual misconduct” is an umbrella term that encompasses 
various types of prohibited conduct, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, 
domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. The President is authorized and directed 
to establish procedures to define other terms relevant to this Policy, including but not 
limited to: “sexual harassment”, “sexual assault”, “domestic violence”, “dating violence”, 
and “stalking”. 

III. Applicability 
All students and employees of the College must comply with this Policy. Sexual 
misconduct is prohibited between students, between employees, between students and 
employees, and by students or employees against contractors, vendors, or other 
individuals whose relationship to the student or employee is through the College’s 
facilities, programs or activities. Similarly, the College will not tolerate sexual misconduct 
by College contractors, vendors, or other third parties, including visitors and guests to the 
College whose relationship to the victim is through the College’s facilities, programs, or 
activities. This Policy applies regardless of the sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity 
of either the perpetrator or the victim of the sexual misconduct. This Policy applies to 
sexual misconduct (i) that occurs on College premises, including any property owned or 
leased by the College (including College buses) or that the College has permission to 
occupy for purposes of conducting a College-sponsored program or event; (ii) that occurs 
in connection with any College-sponsored, College-recognized, or College-approved 
activities within the United States (e.g., off-campus education programs and activities 
such as College-sponsored field trips, athletic team travel, and events for officially 
recognized College clubs that occur off-campus, and social activities for employees 
sponsored by the College or relating to the business of the College); (iii) that occurs 
during business travel in the United States or otherwise in connection with College-
related business; or (iv) sexual harassment on-or off-campus during any college-
sponsored activity that impacts equal educational opportunity or access. All incidents of 
sexual misconduct should be reported so that the College may determine whether the 
conduct falls within the scope of this Policy. 

IV. Reporting and Confidentiality 
All members of the Montgomery College community may report allegations of sexual 

Page 1 of 5 


POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 31001 

misconduct at any time, but are encouraged to make such reports promptly in order to 
maximize the College’s ability to respond and take appropriate action, including to obtain 
evidence and to conduct a prompt and equitable investigation. 

Students may report alleged sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator or to any 
“Mandated Reporter,” which includes any College administrator, supervisor, faculty 
member, public safety officer, coach, or trainer. Employees and other members of the 
College community may report sexual misconduct to the Title IX Coordinator or the 
Director of Employee and Labor Relations, and employees may also report sexual 
misconduct to their supervisor. A Mandated Reporter, the Director of Employee and 
Labor Relations, and any other employee who receives a report of sexual misconduct 
must promptly relay such report to the Title IX Coordinator. No employee is authorized to 
investigate or resolve reports of sexual misconduct without the involvement of the Title IX 
Coordinator. 

The College’s designated Title IX Coordinator can be reached by email at 
TitleIX@montgomerycollege.edu.1 The Title IX Coordinator is available to meet on any 
campus by appointment. Members of the College community may contact the Title IX 
Coordinator in order to seek information about courses of action available to resolve 
reports or complaints that involve sexual misconduct; to file a formal complaint; to get 
information about available resources and supports services available to victims of sexual 
misconduct; and, to ask any questions concerning College Policies and Procedures 
relating to sexual misconduct. 

Certain College employees will be designated Confidential Resources for purposes of 
this policy. Confidential Resources are not considered to be Mandated Reporters – that 
is, upon receipt of a report of alleged sexual misconduct, Confidential Resources are not 
required to notify the Title IX Coordinator. An individual seeking support or guidance with 
respect to an alleged incident of sexual misconduct may contact any Confidential 
Resource, who will normally keep private the individual’s identity and any other 
information concerning the incident. 

The College recognizes that allegations of sexual misconduct are a sensitive subject for 
all parties involved and is committed to maintaining the privacy of the parties involved to 
the fullest extent possible, consistent with applicable law and the need for investigation 
and resolution. The College, through the Title IX Coordinator, may sign a formal 
complaint to initiate the investigation and formal resolution process even when the 
individual making a report of sexual misconduct requests anonymity or requests that no 
action be taken. Thus, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. In all cases, the 
College will take care to protect the identity of the parties through processes that provide 
for discussion of the allegations only among those who have a legitimate administrative, 
investigative, or legal need to know. 

V. College Aid to Victims of Sexual Misconduct 
The President is authorized and directed to establish procedures to provide victims of 

1 The President is authorized to change the designation of the Title IX Coordinator by a procedure that provides the name 
and contact information of the Title IX Coordinator similar to the information provided in this Policy. Upon adoption of the 
procedure with this information and the posting of notice of the change to the College’s web site, this Policy may be 
modified by direction of the President to substitute the new information about the Title IX Coordinator without the need for 
further action of the Board of Trustees. 

Page 2 of 5 


POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 31001 

sexual misconduct with reasonable accommodations (e.g., changes in academic, 
transportation and/or working situations) and/or supportive measures that will be made 
available upon a report of sexual misconduct to a victim of sexual misconduct, regardless 
of whether the victim chooses to report the sexual misconduct to campus security or local 
law enforcement. 

VI. Investigation 
All reports of sexual misconduct will be taken seriously and investigated as appropriate. 
The President is authorized and directed to establish procedures for the investigation of 
such reports, which shall provide for a prompt, thorough, and impartial process. 

VII. Time Frame 
The College strives to investigate all complaints within sixty (60) days after the filing of a 
complaint. Actual resolution time may vary depending on many factors, including but not 
limited to, the complexity of the investigation and the severity and extent of the alleged 
misconduct. 

VIII. Sanctions 
It is presumed that a Respondent is not responsible for the alleged conduct until a 
determination regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the grievance 
process. Individuals found to have committed sexual misconduct in violation of this Policy 
will be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with applicable College policies and 
procedures and/or collective bargaining agreements. 

Employees found in violation of this Policy are subject to disciplinary action in accordance 
with the applicable College policies and procedures for disciplinary action and discharge 
(34002 and 34003), or, for bargaining unit members, the applicable procedures in the 
collective bargaining agreement. Sanctions will be based on the circumstances and 
nature of the violation, ranging from a reprimand up to and including termination of 
employment. Students found in violation of this Policy are subject to disciplinary action in 
accordance with procedures set forth in the Student Code of Conduct (42001). Sanctions 
will be based on the circumstances and nature of the violation and include, but are not 
limited to, a warning, disciplinary probation, community service, participation in sexual 
misconduct education programming, suspension and dismissal from the College. In the 
event of sexual misconduct by a third party against a College student or employee, the 
College will take appropriate action within its control to address the misconduct and 
prevent its recurrence, including but not limited to, referring to local law enforcement to 
issue a “No Trespass” notice denying access to the College’s buildings and grounds. 

As required or appropriate, parties will be informed of the outcome of any resolution 
process based on a violation of this Policy. 

Persons who commit sexual misconduct in violation of federal, state, or local law may 
also be subject to criminal charges and penalties as a result of related legal proceedings. 

IX. Evidentiary Standard 
In any investigation and/or disciplinary proceeding concerning an alleged violation of this 
Policy, the finding will be determined by a preponderance of the evidence. The burden of 
collecting evidence and proving a violation of policy is the responsibility of the College 

Page 3 of 5 


POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 31001 

and not the individuals. 

X. Good Faith Reporting 
Allegations of sexual misconduct are extremely serious, with potential for great harm to 
the accused if ill-conceived or made with malice. An individual found to have knowingly 
filed a false allegation may be subject to separate appropriate disciplinary action. A 
complaint made in good faith is not considered false merely because the evidence does 
not ultimately support the allegation of sexual misconduct. 

XI. Retaliation 
The College prohibits retaliation by anyone in the College community against an 
individual because the individual reports or complains about sexual misconduct or 
participates in the College’s investigation or proceedings related to an allegation of 
sexual misconduct. When the College is aware of possible retaliation, it will take 
immediate and appropriate steps to investigate. Students or employees who commit 
retaliation in violation of this Policy are subject to appropriate disciplinary action. The 
Complainant or participants in any report or investigation of sexual misconduct who 
believe they have experienced retaliation in violation of this Policy should immediately 
report such conduct to the Title IX Coordinator. 

XII. Education 
Education is a key element of this Policy. Notice of this Policy will be provided to all 
students during admissions and all employees during onboarding. The College will 
provide education and information, as appropriate, for students and employees to 
enhance understanding and increase awareness of the College’s Sexual Misconduct 
Policy and Procedures. Sufficient periodic training will be conducted for Mandated 
Reporters and for those involved in the investigation and resolution of complaints and 
appeals, as determined by the President. Records and verification of all training will be 
maintained by the Title IX Coordinator and published on the Title IX website. Any 
mandatory education requirements will be announced and posted on the College’s 
website. The President is authorized to provide institutional leadership and guidance for 
developing education programs to increase knowledge and share information and 
resources to prevent sexual misconduct, promote safety, and reduce perpetration. Some 
goals to be achieved through education are: (a) ensuring that all individuals are aware of 
their rights; (b) notifying individuals of conduct that is proscribed; (c) informing 
employees, students, and other members of the college community, including 
contractors, about the proper way to recognize and address complaints involving a 
violation of this Policy; (d) preventing issues that this Policy addresses, and; (e) 
identifying the necessary steps for preventing sexual misconduct and addressing its 
effects. 

XIII. The President is authorized and directed to establish procedures to implement this 
Policy.

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 007 
Subject: Sexual Misconduct 

I. Introduction 
A. Montgomery College is committed to establishing and maintaining an 
environment in which all members of the Montgomery College community can 
work and participate in College education programs and activities free from all 
forms of sexual misconduct, as defined in Section II below. Sexual misconduct 
will not be tolerated and the College will consider any violation as a significant act 
of misconduct that will result in disciplinary action. When made aware, the 
College will take immediate action to stop the misconduct, prevent its recurrence, 
and remedy its effects. The resolution processes described herein relating to 
reports of sexual misconduct will be prompt, thorough, and impartial and provide

conducted by College officials who, at minimum, receive annual training on 
issues related to sexual misconduct.

1. Treatment with dignity, respect, and sensitivity by the official of the 
College during all phases of the disciplinary process.

a. Access to the evidence regarding the incident obtained by the 
College during the investigation or considered by the College, 
with personally identifiable or other information redacted as

employee or the College to comply with mandatory reporting laws, such as those 
applicable to sexual or other abuse of minors. In all cases, College employees 
and the College will comply with Montgomery College Policy 75005-Protection of 
Minors. 
II. Applicability 
Sexual misconduct is prohibited between students, between employees, between 
students and employees, and by students or employees against contractors, vendors, or 
other individuals whose relationship to the student or employee is through the College’s 
facilities, programs, or activities. Similarly, the College will not tolerate sexual misconduct 
by College contractors, vendors, or other third parties, including visitors and guests to the 
College, whose relationship to the victim is through the College’s facilities, programs, or 
activities. 

A. These procedures apply regardless of the sex, sexual orientation, or gender 
identity and expression of either the perpetrator or the victim of sexual 
misconduct. 
B. These procedures apply to sexual misconduct that: 
1. occurs on College premises, including any property owned or leased by 
the College (including College vehicles) or that the College has 
permission to occupy for purposes of conducting a College-sponsored 
program or event; 
2. occurs in connection with any College-sponsored, College-recognized, or 
College-approved activities within the United States (e.g., off-campus 
education programs and activities such as College-sponsored field trips, 
athletic team travel, and events for officially recognized College clubs 
that occur off campus, and social activities for employees sponsored by 
the College or relating to the business of the College); 
3. occurs during business travel within the United States or otherwise in 
connection with College-related business; and, 
4. sexual harassment on or off campus in any College program or activity 
Page 2 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

that impacts equal educational access. 

C. All incidents of sexual misconduct should be reported so that the College may 
determine whether the conduct falls within the scope of the Policy and may 
respond appropriately under these procedures. 
III. Definitions 
The following capitalized defined terms are used throughout the Procedure: 

A. Advisor – A person chosen by a party or appointed by the institution to 
accompany the party to meetings related to the resolution process, to advise the 
party on that process, and to conduct questioning for the party at the hearing, if 
any. 
B. Complainant -refers to an individual who is alleged to be the victim of 
conduct that could constitute sexual harassment. 
C. Confidential Resource – specific College employees whose role under this 
procedure is limited to providing confidential support and guidance to any 
individuals who wish to discuss alleged incidents of sexual misconduct. 
Confidential resources are specific College employees who are not considered to 
be Mandated Reporters and therefore are not required to notify the Title IX 
Coordinator (or alternatively, if the sexual misconduct is by or against an 
employee, the Director of Employee and Labor Relations) upon receipt of a 
report of sexual misconduct. 
D. Consent – a knowing, voluntary, and affirmatively communicated willingness to 
participate in a particular sexual activity or behavior. Only a person who has the 
ability and capacity to exercise free will and make rational, reasonable judgment 
can give Consent. Consent may be expressed either by words and/or by actions 
as long as those words and/or actions create a mutually understandable 
agreement to engage in specific sexual activity. It is the responsibility of the 
person who wants to engage in sexual activity to ensure that they have consent 
from the other party, and that the other party is capable of providing consent. 
1. Lack of protest or resistance is not consent, nor may silence, in and of 
itself, be interpreted as consent. For that reason, relying solely on nonverbal 
communication can lead to misunderstanding. 
2. Consent to any one form of sexual activity cannot automatically imply 
consent to any other forms of sexual activity. 
3. Previous relationships, including past sexual relationships or prior 
consent cannot imply consent to future sexual acts. 
4. Consent must be present throughout sexual activity and may be 
withdrawn at any time. If there is confusion as to whether there is 
consent or whether prior consent has been withdrawn, it is essential that 
the participants stop the activity until the confusion is resolved. 
5. In order to give effective consent, one must be of legal age, as defined 
by applicable Maryland law. 
Page 3 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

Sexual activity that is forced or coerced is by definition non-consensual. Force is 
the use of physical violence and/or imposing on someone physically to gain 
sexual access. Force also includes threats, intimidation (implied threats) and 
coercion that overcome resistance or produce consent. There is no requirement 
that a party resist the sexual advance or request, but resistance is a clear 
demonstration of non-consent. Coercion is unreasonable pressure for sexual 
activity. Coercive behavior differs from seductive behavior based on the type of 
pressure used to obtain consent. Frequency, intensity, isolation, and duration of 
the behavior will be considered in making a determination of whether coercion 
occurred. When a party makes clear that they do not want to engage in sex, that 
they want to stop, or that they do not want to go past a certain point of sexual 
interaction, continued pressure beyond that point can be coercive. Coercing 
someone into sexual activity violates this Policy in the same way as physically 
forcing someone into sex. 

It is a violation of Policy 31001 to engage in sexual activity with someone whom 
one knows to be ─ 
or 
based on the circumstances 
should reasonably 
have 
known to be 
─ 
mentally 
or 
physically incapacitated. To be incapacitated means 
that a person’s decision-making ability is impaired such that they lack capacity to 
understand the “who, what, where, why, or how” of their sexual interaction. 
Incapacitation may result from sleep or unconsciousness, temporary or 
permanent mental or physical disability, involuntary physical restraint, or the 
influence of drugs or alcohol. 

E. Corrective Action – action(s) recommended by the Hearing Officer in consultation 
with appropriate administrator to be taken to sanction the Respondent and 
provide appropriate remedies to the Complainant, if the Hearing Officer 
concludes that there has been a violation of the College’s Sexual Misconduct 
Policy. 
F. Dating violence – Violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social 
relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim. The existence of 
such a relationship shall be determined based on the complainant’s statement 
and with consideration of the length of the relationship, the type of relationship, 
and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. 
For the purposes of this definition, dating violence includes, but is not limited to, 
sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse. Dating violence does not 
include acts covered under the definition of domestic violence. 
G. Domestic violence – encompasses a broad range of behaviors, including Sexual 
Assault, physical abuse and other forms of violence committed by a current or 
former spouse or intimate partner of the Complainant, by a person with whom the 
Complainant shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or 
has cohabitated with the Complainant as a spouse or intimate partner, by a 
person similarly situated to a spouse of the Complainant, or by any other person 
against an adult or youth Complainant protected from those acts by domestic or 
family violence laws of Maryland. 
H. Formal Complaint – a document filed by a complainant or 
signed by the Title IX Coordinator alleging sexual harassment against a 
respondent and requesting that the College investigate the allegation of 
Page 4 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

sexual harassment. A formal complaint may be filed with the Title IX Coordinator 
in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information listed 
for the Title IX Coordinator, or through the Sexual Misconduct Report form. 

I. Formal Resolution – one of several available routes for resolution of allegations 
of sexual misconduct under this Procedure. Formal Resolution involves a 
prompt, fair, and impartial fact-finding Investigation and live hearing. 
J. Incapacitated -an individual who is Incapacitated is unable to give Consent to 
sexual contact. States of Incapacitation include sleep, unconsciousness, 
intermittent consciousness, or any other state where the individual is unaware 
that sexual contact is occurring. Incapacitation may also exist because of a 
mental or developmental disability that impairs the ability to Consent to sexual 
contact. Alcohol or drug use is one of the prime causes of Incapacitation. 
However, a person is not incapacitated merely because they have been drinking 
or using drugs. Where alcohol or other substances are involved, incapacitation is 
determined by how the substance impacts a person’s decision-making capacity, 
awareness of consequences, and ability to make informed judgments. Because 
the impact of alcohol or other drugs varies from person to person, evaluating 
whether an individual is Incapacitated, and therefore unable to give Consent, 
requires an assessment of whether the consumption of alcohol or other drugs 
has rendered the individual physically helpless or substantially incapable of: 
1. making decisions about the potential consequences of sexual contact; 
2. appraising the nature of one’s own conduct; 
3. communicating Consent to sexual contact; or 
4. communicating unwillingness to engage in sexual contact. 
K. Informal Resolution – a remedies-based, non-judicial style approach designed to 
address allegations of sexual misconduct without taking disciplinary action 
against a Respondent. Informal Resolution may not be appropriate for resolving 
allegations of some types of sexual misconduct. 
L. Initial Title IX Intake– an assessment, conducted by the Title IX Coordinator upon 
receipt of a report of an alleged violation of Policy 31001-Sexual Misconduct, to 
provide an integrated and coordinated response to a report of sexual misconduct. 
M. Supportive Measures – individualized services reasonably available that are 
nonpunitive, non-disciplinary, and not unreasonably burdensome to the other 
party while designed to ensure equal educational access, protect safety, or deter 
sexual harassment. 
N. Investigation – a prompt and thorough process for providing a fair and reliable 
means of gathering relevant and factual information in the course of Formal 
Resolution. 
O. Investigator – the College official, or designee, responsible for conducting 
investigations of reports of sexual misconduct. The College may engage internal 
or external individuals who are trained to conduct the resolution processes 
described in these procedures. 
P. Hearing Officer -is a "presiding officer" in a full hearing for the purpose of 
conducting a full adjudicative proceeding under this policy.

U. Sexual Harassment – Conduct on the basis of sex that satisfies one or more of 
the following: 
1. An employee conditioning the provision of an aid,

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

3. any instance of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or 
stalking. 
V. Sexual Misconduct – is an umbrella term that encompasses Dating Violence, 
Domestic Violence, Sexual Violence, Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, and 
Stalking. Sexual Misconduct can occur between strangers or acquaintances, 
including people involved in an intimate or sexual relationship. Sexual 
Misconduct can be committed by any person, regardless of gender identity, and 
can occur between people of the same or different sex, sexual orientation, or 
gender expression. 
W. Support Person -an individual age eighteen (18) or older who is not a 
Complainant or Respondent to the alleged misconduct and who serves as a 
silent and non-participating presence during any part of the processes under this 
Procedure. The role of the Support Person is solely to observe and provide moral 
support to a Complainant or Respondent in a way that does not disrupt or delay 
the process. 
X. Stalking – Engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that 
would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her safety or the safety of 
others or suffer substantial emotional distress. Course of conduct means two or 
more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, 
indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, 
follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about, a 
person, or interferes with a person's property. Substantial emotional distress 
means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily 
require medical or other professional treatment or counseling. “Reasonable 
person” means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar 
identities to the victim. 
Y. Third-Party Witness -an individual who may have relevant direct or 
circumstantial knowledge or information about the alleged misconduct.

IV. Confidential Resources 
Generally, it is not confidential when a person reports Sexual Misconduct. If a person 
desires to keep an incident of Sexual Misconduct confidential, they should speak with 
individuals who have professional or legal obligations to keep communications 
confidential. When seeking advice and support, persons should always consider whether 
they want to discuss their concerns with a confidential resource. Unless there is an 
imminent threat to health or safety or other basis for disclosure, such as child abuse, 
confidentiality applies when persons seek services from the following resources. 

A. Internal Confidential Reporting 
1. Certain College employees have been deemed Confidential Resources 
for purposes of this Procedure: 
a. For Students (contact a counselor directly):

individual’s identity. 

3. Discussing an alleged incident of sexual misconduct with a Confidential 
Resource will not lead to an investigation or resolution of the incident. 
Confidential Resources do not have the authority to establish supportive 
measures or take corrective action. 
B. External Confidential Reporting 
Individuals who are seeking information and support may also contact the

V. Reporting Sexual Misconduct 
The College encourages all individuals to make a report to the College and to local law 
enforcement whenever a crime may have been committed. The College will assist 
Complainant who wish to report sexual misconduct to law enforcement authorities. 
Reports to law enforcement and reports to the College can be pursued simultaneously. 

A. Emergency Situations 
1. If there is an immediate threat, if possible and necessary go to a safe 
location, and if injured, seek immediate medical attention.

Page 9 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

B. Internal Reporting 
1. A report of sexual misconduct may be made at any time. Members of the 
College community are encouraged to make reports promptly in order to 
maximize the College’s ability to obtain evidence, identify potential 
witnesses, and conduct a thorough, prompt, fair, and equitable 
investigation. 
a. Students may report alleged sexual misconduct: 
i. to the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or 
electronic mail; 
ii. to any other Mandated Reporter, as defined in Section 
III; or 
iii. through the online Formal Sexual Misconduct Report 
Form 
b. Employees and other members of the College community who 
are not students may report sexual misconduct: 
i. to the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or 
electronic mail; 
ii. to the Director of Employee and Relations; 
iii. to any other Mandated Reporter, as defined in Section 
III; or 
iv. through the online Sexual Misconduct Report Form. 
c. At the time of filing a formal complaint, a Complainant must be 
participating in or attempting to participate in the education 
program or activity of the school with which the formal complaint 
is filed. 
d. When the College has knowledge of sexual harassment, but the 
Complainant has chosen to not file a formal complaint, the Title 
IX Coordinator may sign a formal complaint initiating the formal 
resolution process. Where the Title IX Coordinator signs a formal 
complaint, the Title IX Coordinator is not a complainant or a party 
during the resolution process. 
2. Upon receiving a report, the College shall immediately inform the 
Complainant of available options about the involvement of law 
enforcement, including the Complainant’s option to: 
a. notify law enforcement authorities, including the campus Public 
Safety and local police; 
b. decline to notify such authorities; and 
c. be promptly assisted by the College, at the victim’s request, in 
notifying local law enforcement authorities and in obtaining 
appropriate medical attention, including arranging transportation 
to the nearest hospital equipped with the Maryland State Police 
Page 10 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

sexual assault evidence collection kit. In Montgomery County, 
the only facility equipped with the Maryland State Police sexual 
assault evidence collection kit (SAFE) and specially trained 
forensic nurses is: 

Shady Grove Adventist Hospital 
Forensic Medical Unit 
9901 Medical Center Drive 
Rockville, MD 20850 

This is the best option to ensure preservation of evidence that 
may assist in proving that a criminal offense occurred or may be 
helpful in obtaining a protection order. 

3. The College will provide support that can assist each Complainant in 
making decisions about whether or not to request any particular course 
of action. To the extent possible and reasonable, the College will respect 
a Complainant’s autonomy in deciding how to proceed. In this process, 
the College will balance the Complainant’s interest with its obligation to 
provide a safe and non-discriminatory environment for all members of 
the College community. 
4. Safe Harbor 
To encourage reporting, an individual who reports sexual misconduct, 
either as a Complainant or a Third-Party Witness, will not be subject to 
disciplinary action by the College for a violation of the College’s alcohol 
or drug use policies if: 

a. The violation occurred during or near the time of the alleged 
sexual misconduct violation; 
b. The individual is determined to have made the report or is 
participating in an investigation as a witness in good faith; and 
c. The College determines that the violation was not an act that 
was reasonably likely to place the health or safety of another 
individual at risk. 
The College may, however, initiate an educational or employment 
discussion or pursue other remedies regarding alcohol or other drugs. 

5. Obligations of “Mandatory Reporters” 
A Mandatory Reporter must promptly notify the Title IX Coordinator of 
any report of Sexual Misconduct brought to their attention, including 
Public Safety. The Title IX Coordinator works collaboratively with the 
reporting entity, making every effort to operate with discretion and 
maintain the privacy of the individuals involved. The Mandatory Reporter 
is not authorized to take corrective action. 

C. External Reporting 
In addition, members of the College community may also report instances of 
sexual misconduct to applicable federal, state, or local government agencies

D. Retaliation 
The College prohibits retaliation by anyone in the College community against an 
individual because the individual reports sexual misconduct or participates in the 
College’s processes related to an allegation of sexual misconduct as described in 
this Procedure. When the College is aware of possible retaliation, it will take 
immediate steps to investigate. Students or employees who commit retaliation in 
violation of Policy 31001 are subject to appropriate disciplinary action. A 
Complainant or other participant in any proceedings described in this Procedure 
who believes they have experienced retaliation in violation of Policy 31001 
should immediately report such conduct to the Title IX Coordinator. 

VI. Resolution Process 
A. Initial Title IX Assessment 
1. The College will meet with the Complainant to conduct an Initial Title IX 
Assessment when made aware of an allegation. For allegations involving 
students, the Title IX Assessment will be conducted by the Title IX 
Coordinator. For allegations involving employees, the Title IX 
Assessment will be conducted by the Director of Employee and Labor 
Relations. The Initial Title IX Assessment will: 
a. Assess any immediate threats to the safety of the Complainant and 
the College community; 
b. Inform the Complainant of their right to seek medical treatment and 
report to law enforcement; 
c. Provide supportive measures to ensure equal educational access; 
d. Determine whether the allegation could be a possible violation of the 
Sexual Misconduct policy 
e. Provide the Complainant a copy of the Sexual Misconduct Policy and 
information on any College and community resources; 
f. Discuss adjudication options and procedures for resolution; 
g. Inquire about the Complainant’s expressed preference regarding 
Page 12 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

confidentiality and resolution, including any request that no further 

action be taken; and 

h. Determine next steps, including possibility of informal resolution, 
initiation of a formal investigation, no cause, referral to appropriate 
disciplinary process, or referral for timely warning under the Clery 
Act. 
2. Dismissal (Mandatory and Discretionary) 
The College must dismiss a Formal Complaint or any allegations therein 
if, at any time during the investigation or hearing, it is determined that: 

a. The conduct alleged in the Formal Complaint would not 
constitute Title IX Sexual Harassment as defined above, even if 
proved 
b. The conduct did not occur in an educational program or activity 
controlled by the College (including buildings or property 
controlled by recognized student organizations), and/or the 
College does not have control of the Respondent 
c. The conduct did not occur against a person in the United States 
d. At the time of filing a Formal Complaint, a Complainant is not 
participating in or attempting to participate in the College’s 
education program or activity, and based on the available 
information, the Title IX Coordinator has determined that they do 
not need to sign a Formal Complaint on behalf of the College 
The College may dismiss a Formal Complaint or any allegations therein 
if, at any time during the investigation or hearing: 

a. A Complainant notifies the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the 
Complainant would like to withdraw the Formal Complaint or any 
allegations therein 
b. The Respondent is no longer enrolled in or employed by the 
College 
c. Specific circumstances prevent the College from gathering 
evidence sufficient to reach a determination as to the Formal 
Complaint or allegations therein 
A Complainant who decides to withdraw a complaint may later request to 
reinstate it or refile it. 

Upon any dismissal, the College will promptly send written notice of the 
dismissal and the rationale for doing so simultaneously to the parties. 

This dismissal decision is appealable by any party under the procedures 
for appeal. 

3. Allegations Made by a Third-Party Witness 
a. Any person may report sexual misconduct whether or not the 
person reporting is the person alleged to be the victim of conduct 
that could constitute sexual misconduct, in person, by mail, by 
Page 13 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

telephone, or by e-mail, using the contact information listed for 
the Title IX Coordinator, or by any other means that results in the 
IX Coordinator receiving the person’s verbal or written report. 
Such a report may be made at any time, including during nonbusiness 
hours, by using the telephone number or e-mail 
address, or by mail to the office address, listed for the Title IX 
Coordinator. 

b. If a report has been made by a Third-Party Witness or other 
individual with knowledge of sexual misconduct but no report has 
been made by the individual against whom the violation is 
alleged to have been committed, the Title IX Coordinator will 
contact the individual against whom the violation is alleged to 
have been committed. 
c. The Title IX Coordinator will provide the individual an opportunity 
to make a formal complaint, review supportive measures, and to 
become a Complainant for purposes of this Procedure. 
d. The individual is not obligated to make such a report or to 
participate in the Initial Title IX Assessment or any subsequent 
processes. 
e. In addition, the individual may request that the College not 
investigate or take any action against the Respondent. 
B. Supportive Measures 
As part of the Initial Title IX Assessment, the College will make an immediate 
assessment of whether supportive measures are appropriate based on the 
particular circumstances. The College will treat complainants and respondents 
equitably, meaning that for a complainant, the College will offer supportive 
measures, and for a respondent, the College will follow the adjudication process 
before imposing disciplinary sanctions. These steps ensure the restoration or 
preservation of equal educational access of the parties, protect safety, and deter 
sexual harassment without unreasonably burdening the other party. Supportive 
measures are available to both parties and to the Complainant, regardless if a 
formal complaint is filed. When deemed in the best interests to protect the parties 
and the College community, the following interim remedies can be implemented 
with proper notice to both parties where appropriate: 

a. Providing information on available medical services; 
b. Access to counseling services and assistance in setting up initial 
counseling appointment, both on-and off-campus; 
c. Imposition of campus “No Contact Letter” (i.e., an official College 
directive that serves as a notice to an individual that they must 
not have verbal, electronic, written, or third-party 
communications with another individual); 
Page 14 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

d. Change in work schedule or job assignment or reassignment to 
other work group/team, or an alternative supervisor/management 
relationship; 
e. Limit an individual or organization’s access to certain College 
facilities or activities pending resolution of the matter; 
f. Voluntary leave of absence; 
g. Providing an escort to ensure safe movement between classes 
and activities; 
h. Rescheduling of assignment(s) and/or examination(s) (in 
consultation with appropriate faculty); 
i. Providing alternative course completion options (with the 
agreement of the appropriate faculty); 
j. Change in class schedule, including the ability to take an 
“incomplete,” drop a course without penalty, or transfer sections 
(with the agreement of the appropriate faculty); 
k. Providing academic support services, such as tutoring; 
l. Any other remedy that can be tailored to protect the parties and 
achieve the goals of this policy; and 
m. Where a respondent poses an immediate threat to the physical 
health or safety of the complainant or the campus community, 
emergency interim withdrawal or College-imposed leave: 
i. For students, emergency interim withdrawal pursuant to 
Campus Behavioral Intervention Teams -42002; or 
ii. For employees, College-imposed leave pursuant to 
Disciplinary Action and Suspension -34002. 
The College will implement the least restrictive emergency 
actions possible in light of the circumstances and safety 
concerns. 

All individuals are encouraged to report to the Title IX Coordinator concerns 
about failure of another individual to abide by any restrictions imposed by a 
supportive measure. The College will take immediate and responsive action to 
enforce the measure. 

C. Grievance Process 
The College resolves sexual misconduct complaints in one of two ways: informal 
resolution and formal resolution. 

1. Informal Resolution – includes a variety of informal options for resolving 
Page 15 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

reports. 

2. Investigation and Formal Resolution – includes an investigation, review, 
live hearing, outcome determination, and sanctions, if applicable. 
D. Informal Resolution 
The informal resolution process may be used at any point prior to reaching a 
determination of responsibility as long as a formal complaint has been filed and 
an employee is not the respondent. The College may use mediation or other 
informal mechanisms for resolving complaints related to a complaint alleging 
violation of this policy if: 

1. All parties provide voluntary, written consent to use the informal process; 
2. The College participates in the informal resolution by providing trained 
staff; 
3. The alleged misconduct does not involve sexual assault or sexual 
coercion; and 
4. All parties are provided with a written notice that includes: 
a. The allegations. 
b. The requirements of the informal resolution process including the 
circumstances under which it precludes the parties from 
resuming a formal complaint arising from the same allegations. 
c. At any time prior to agreeing to a resolution, the right of any party 
to withdraw from the informal resolution process and resume the 
grievance process with respect to the formal complaint. 
d. Any consequences resulting from participating in the informal 
resolution process, including the records that will be maintained 
or could be shared. 
e. For the purposes of this procedure, a student employee is not 
considered an employee for purposes of informal resolution. 
E. Investigation of a Formal Complaint 
1. An investigation/formal resolution begins with the filing of a formal 
complaint by the Complainant or Title IX Coordinator. 
2. The College shall initiate a prompt, thorough, and impartial Investigation 
to gather relevant information. Any subsequent disciplinary proceedings 
and resolutions shall be prompt and equitable and provide an opportunity 
for the Complainant and Respondent to be heard. 
3. Investigations involve interviews with all relevant parties and witnesses; 
obtaining available, relevant evidence; and identifying sources of expert 
information, as necessary. All parties have a full and fair opportunity, 
through the investigation process, to suggest witnesses and questions, 
to provide evidence, and to fully review and respond to all evidence, on 
the record. 
4. A Notice of Investigation will be issued to both parties within ten (10) 
business days upon determination by the Title IX Coordinator that the 
alleged offense is within scope of the Policy and will include the 
Page 16 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

following: 

a. Summary of the allegation, including time, date, and location of 
the alleged violation; 
b. Potential violation(s) of Policy 31001 – Sexual Misconduct; 
c. List of possible sanctions that may be imposed upon a finding 
that a violation has occurred; 
d. The identity of the Investigator (and any applicable assistant); 
e. Available College and community resources and services; 
f. Invitation for both parties to submit a written statement and 
identify any third-party witnesses with information relevant to the 
complaint; 
g. The rights and responsibilities of each party 
1) statement that the respondent is presumed not 
responsible for the alleged conduct until a determination 
regarding responsibility is made at the conclusion of the 
formal resolution process; 
2) a statement that the parties may request to see and 
review evidence collected in an investigation. 
3) The right to a Support Person and an Attorney or Non-
Attorney Advisor, and the roles of such persons; 
h. Availability and possibility of criminal and civil court options; 
i. An outline of the process, including the contact information for 
the investigator and any required meetings that may be required; 
and 
j. The College’s prohibition against retaliation. 
5. The Investigation will be conducted by an investigator (internal or 
external) who is trained on the definition of sexual harassment under 
Title IX regulations, the scope of the recipient's education program or 
activity, how to conduct an investigation and grievance process including 
hearings, appeals, and informal resolution processes, as applicable, and 
how to serve impartially, including by avoiding prejudgment of the facts 
at issue, conflicts of interest, bias, and issues of relevance to create an 
investigative report that fairly summarizes relevant evidence.. 
6. An investigation typically contains the following elements: 
a. Commence a thorough, reliable, and impartial investigation 
by identifying issues and developing a strategic investigation 
plan, including a witness list, evidence list, intended 
investigation timeframe, and order of interviews for all 
witnesses and the respondent. 
b. Complete the investigation promptly and without 
unreasonable deviation from the intended timeline. 
c. Conduct interviews with the Complainant and Respondent to 
gather facts about the allegation. 
d. Allow each party the opportunity to suggest witnesses and 
offer potential questions to consider asking to help uncover 
relevant facts related to the allegation.

If and when additional material alterations to allegations 
arise, communicate this promptly to the parties. This notice 
will provide the parties with a summary of the additions or 
alterations of the allegations, as well as any changes to the 
policies implicated. 
Provide the parties and witnesses an opportunity to review 
and verify the investigator’s summary notes from their 
respective interviews and meetings. 
Write a comprehensive investigation report fully summarizing 
the investigation, all witness interviews, and addressing all 
relevant evidence, copies of which are to be included in an 
appendix to the report. 
At the conclusion of the investigation, provide the parties and 
their respective advisors (if so desired by the parties) a copy 
of the draft investigation report. 
Provide the parties with an equal opportunity to inspect and 
review the evidence obtained as part of the investigation that 
is directly related to the reported misconduct, including 
evidence upon which the College does not intend to rely in 
reaching a responsibility determination, so that each party 
may meaningfully respond to the evidence. 
Prior to the conclusion of the investigation, provide the 
parties and their respective Advisors (if so desired by the 
parties) a secured electronic or hard copy of the draft 
investigation report as well as an opportunity to inspect and 
review all of the evidence obtained as part of the 
investigation that is directly related to the reported 
misconduct, including evidence upon which the College does 
not intend to rely in reaching a determination, for a ten (10) 
calendar-day review and comment period so that each party 
may meaningfully respond to the evidence. The parties may 
elect to waive the full ten (10) days. 
Incorporate relevant elements of the parties’ written 
responses into the final investigation report, include any 
additional relevant evidence, make any necessary revisions, 
and finalize the report. The Investigator(s) should document 
all rationales for any changes made after the review and 
comment period. 
Incorporate any relevant feedback and share the final report 
with all parties and their Advisors at least ten (10) calendar 
days prior to a hearing. The parties and Advisors are also 
provided with a file of any directly related evidence that was 
not included in the report. 
Within 3 days of receiving the final investigation report, if the 
Parties wish to propose any additional witnesses not 
included in the investigation, notice must be provided to the 
Title IX Coordinator including list of the names of witnesses. 
No unauthorized audio or video recording of any kind is 
permitted during investigation meetings. If investigator(s) 
elect to audio and/or video record interviews, all involved 
parties must be made aware of and consent to audio and/or 
video recording. 

Page 18 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

7. The College may dismiss the formal complaint or any allegations therein, 
if at any time during the investigation or hearing: a complainant notifies 
the Title IX Coordinator in writing that the complainant would like to 
withdraw the formal complaint or any allegations therein; the respondent 
is no longer enrolled or employed by the recipient; or specific 
circumstances prevent the recipient from gathering evidence sufficient to 
reach a determination as to the formal complaint or allegations therein. 
8. Upon a dismissal, the College must promptly send written notice of the 
dismissal and reason(s) therefor simultaneously to the parties. The 
notice must contain information about the appeal process. 
F. Advisors 
1. The parties may each have an Advisor of their choice present with them 
for all meetings, interviews, and hearings within the Resolution Process, 
if they so choose. The parties may select whoever they wish to serve as 
their Advisor as long as the Advisor is eligible and available. 
Choosing an Advisor who is also a witness in the process creates 
potential for bias and conflict of interest. A party who chooses an Advisor 
who is also a witness can anticipate that issues of potential bias will be 
explored by the hearing Decision-maker(s). 

The College may permit parties to have more than one Advisor upon 
special request to the Title IX Coordinator. The decision to grant this 
request is at the sole discretion of the Title IX Coordinator and will be 
granted equitably to all parties. 

2. The advisor may be a friend, mentor, family member, attorney, union 
representative or any other individual a party chooses to advise and 
consult with them throughout the resolution process. The parties may 
choose advisors from inside or outside the Montgomery College 
community. The Title IX Coordinator will also offer to assign a trained 
Pool member to serve as an advisor for any party if the party so 
chooses. The parties may choose their advisor from the Pool, a non-
trained advisor from outside the pool, or proceed without an advisor. 
3. The parties may be accompanied by their advisor in all meetings and 
interviews at which the party is entitled to be present, including intake 
and interviews. Advisors should help their advisees prepare for each 
meeting and are expected to advise ethically, with integrity, and in good 
faith. 
4. Montgomery College cannot guarantee equal advisory rights, meaning 
that if one party selects an advisor who is an attorney, but the other party 
does not, or cannot afford an attorney, the College is not obligated to 
provide an attorney. The College will, however, provide a party with an 
advisor selected by the Title IX Coordinator from the Pool if a hearing 
proceeding takes place and the party has not previously been 
accompanied by an advisor. A College-appointed advisor is a process 
advisor who is trained on the institutional process and how to conduct 
Page 19 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

appropriate cross-examination during the hearing. The advisor provided 
by the College is not an advocate or attorney and is not able to provide 
the same kinds of advice that an advocate or attorney is trained to 
provide, but will act in the best interests of their advisee. 

5. Parties may have assistance by a licensed attorney, an advocate 
supervised by an attorney, or a trained advocate throughout the 
disciplinary proceedings, including: 
a. Attendance at hearings, meetings, and interviews, 
b. Private consultations during hearings, meetings, and interviews, 
except during a questioning at a hearing; and 
c. Assistance with the exercise of any rights during the disciplinary 
proceedings. Notwithstanding the choice that the parties make in 
regards to the above, the presence of no more than two people, 
including a personal supporter, an attorney, or an advocate, at 
any hearing, meeting, or interview during the disciplinary 
proceedings. 
6. Student Right to Paid Counsel for College Disciplinary Proceedings 
involving Sexual Assault. 
a. Maryland Law (Education Article of the Annotated Code of 
Maryland, §11-601) requires the Maryland Higher Education 
Commission (MHEC) to pay reasonable costs and attorney’s 
fees, subject to state funding and eligibility requirements, for: 
i. A current or former student who makes a complaint on 
which a formal Title IX investigation is initiated and who 
was enrolled as a student at the time of the incident that 
is the basis of the complaint, unless the student 
knowingly and voluntarily chooses not to have counsel; 
and 
ii. A current or former student who responds to a complaint 
on which a formal Title IX investigation is initiated and 
who was enrolled as a student at the time of the incident 
that is the basis of the complaint, unless the student 
knowingly and voluntarily chooses not to have counsel. 
b. In consultation with State and local bar associations and legal 
services providers with expertise about sexual misconduct, 
MHEC will develop a list of attorneys and legal services 
programs willing to represent students on a pro bono (no cost to 
the student) basis or at fees equivalent to those paid to attorneys 
under civil legal services programs administered by the Maryland 
Legal Services Corporation. 
c. A student may select an attorney from the list developed by 
MHEC to assist them throughout any disciplinary proceedings. 
d. If a student selects and retains an attorney who is not on the list 
developed by MHEC, MHEC will pay fees to the attorney 
selected by the student that are equivalent to those paid to 
Page 20 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

attorneys under civil legal services programs administered by the 
Maryland Legal Services Corporation. 

e. MHEC is not required to pay a student’s attorney fees for 
representation in a criminal or civil matter. 
f. The College may not discourage a student from retaining an 
attorney. 
g. The student right to counsel will not prohibit the College from 
imposing interim safety measures. 
7. All advisors are subject to the same College rules, whether they are 
attorneys or not. Advisors may not address campus officials in a meeting 
or interview unless invited to. The advisor may not make a presentation 
or represent their advisee during any meeting or proceeding and may not 
speak on behalf of the advisee to the investigators or other decision-
makers except during a hearing proceeding, as described below. 
8. The parties are expected to ask and respond to questions on their own 
behalf throughout the investigation. While the advisor generally may not 
speak on behalf of their advisee, the advisor may consult with their 
advisee, either privately as needed, or quietly by passing notes during 
any resolution process meeting or interview, as long as they do not 
disrupt the process. For longer or more involved discussions, the parties 
and their advisors should ask for breaks to step out of meetings to allow 
for private consultation. 
9. Advisors may be given an opportunity to meet with the administrative 
officials conducting interviews/meetings in advance of these interviews or 
meetings. This pre-meeting allows advisors to clarify any questions they 
may have, and allows the College an opportunity to clarify the role the 
advisor is expected to take. 
10. Advisors are expected to refrain from interference with the College’s 
investigation and resolution. Any advisor who interferes with or obstructs 
the investigation and resolution process, or otherwise disregards the 
parameters set forth in this procedure, will be warned once and only 
once. If the advisor continues to disrupt or otherwise fails to respect the 
limits of the advisor role, the advisor will be asked to leave the meeting. 
When an advisor is removed from a meeting, that meeting will typically 
continue without the advisor present. Subsequently, the Title IX 
Coordinator will determine whether the advisor may be reinstated or 
replaced by a different advisor. 
11. The College expects that the parties may wish to have the College share 
documentation and evidentiary information related to the allegations with 
their advisors. Parties may share this information directly with their 
advisor, or other individuals if they wish. Doing so may help the parties 
participate more meaningfully in the resolution process. The College 
provides a consent form that authorizes the College to share such 
information directly with the advisor. The parties must either complete 
this form or provide similar documentation consenting to a release of 
Page 21 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

information to the advisor before the College is able to share records 
with an advisor. While the College seeks consent for information sharing 
with advisors, the College is required to share the final investigation 
report and directly related evidence with the advisor in order to prepare 
for the hearing. If a party requests that all communication be made 
through their attorney advisor, the Institution will comply with that 
request. 

12. Advisors are expected to maintain the privacy of the records shared with 
them. These records may not be shared with third parties, disclosed 
publicly, or used for purposes not explicitly authorized by the College. 
The College may seek to restrict the role of any advisor who does not 
respect the sensitive nature of the process or who fails to abide by the 
Institution’s privacy expectations. 
13. The College expects an advisor to adjust their schedule to allow them to 
attend College meetings when planned. The College does not typically 
change scheduled meetings to accommodate an advisor’s inability to 
attend. The College will, however, make reasonable provisions to allow 
an advisor who cannot attend in person to attend a meeting by 
telephone, video conferencing, or other similar technologies as may be 
convenient and available. 
14. A party may elect to change advisors during the process, and is not 
obligated to use the same advisor throughout. The parties are expected 
to inform the investigators of the identity of their advisor at least one (1) 
day before the date of their first meeting with investigators (or as soon as 
possible if a more expeditious meeting is necessary or desired). The 
parties are expected to provide timely notice to investigators if they 
change advisors at any time. 
15. For parties who are entitled to union representation, the College will 
allow the unionized employee to have their union representative (if 
requested by the party) as well as an advisor of their choice present for 
all resolution-related meetings and interviews. To uphold the principles of 
equity, when at least one of the parties’ request union representation, 
they are entitled to a non-union representative as well. In such cases, the 
other party (regardless of union membership) will be permitted to have 
two advisors. Witnesses are not permitted to have union representation 
or advisors in resolution process interviews or meetings. 
G. Role and Participation of Witnesses 
Witnesses (as distinguished from the parties) who are faculty, students, or staff 
of the College are encouraged cooperate with and participate in the College’s 
investigation and resolution process. 

While in-person interviews for both parties and all potential witnesses are ideal, 
circumstances (e.g. study abroad, summer break) may require individuals to be 
interviewed remotely using technology. Witnesses may also provide written 
statements in lieu of interviews, if deemed appropriate by the investigators, though not 
preferred. 

Page 22 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

H. Assurances to Persons Involved, Safeguarding of Privacy. All individuals, 
including the Complainant, the Respondent, and any Third-Party Witnesses, will 
be treated with appropriate sensitivity and respect. The Investigator will 
safeguard the privacy of the individuals involved in a manner consistent with law 
and College policy and the need to investigate the matter. 
I. Consolidation of Investigations. At the discretion of the Title IX Coordinator, 
multiple reports may be consolidated against a Respondent(s) in one 
Investigation, if the evidence related to each incident would be relevant and 
probative in reaching a determination on the other incident. 
J. Referral for Hearing 
Provided that the contested allegations are not resolved through Informal 
Resolution, the Title IX Coordinator will refer the matter for a hearing at least ten 
(10)days after the conclusion of the investigation, barring unusual 
circumstances. 
1. Notice of Hearing 
At least 10-days prior to the hearing, or as far in advance as is 
reasonably possible if an accelerated hearing is scheduled with the 
consent of the parties, the Hearing Officer will send a letter of notice to 
the parties. Once mailed, emailed, and/or received in-person, notice will 
be presumptively delivered. The letter will contain: 

a. A description of the alleged violation(s), a list of all policies 
allegedly violated, a description of the applicable procedures, 
and a statement of the potential sanctions/responsive actions 
that could result. 
b. The time, date, and location of the hearing and a reminder of the 
importance of their attendance, superseding all other campus 
activities. If any party does not appear at the scheduled hearing, 
the hearing will be held in their absence. For compelling reasons, 
the Hearing Officer may reschedule the hearing. 
c. Notification that the parties may have the assistance of an 
advisor of their choosing at the hearing (See Section on 
“Advisors” above). If any party does not have an advisor, the 
Title IX Coordinator will appoint one from the Pool. 
d. The parties will be provided the names of the Hearing Officer at 
least ten (10) days in advance of the hearing. All objections to 
the Hearing Officer must be raised in writing and submitted to the 
Title IX Coordinator as soon as possible. The Hearing Officer will 
only be removed if the Title IX Coordinator concludes that the 
Hearing Officer’s bias or conflict of interest precludes an 
impartial hearing of the allegation. 
2. Pre-Hearing 
The Hearing Officer, after consultation with the parties as necessary, will 
provide the names of witnesses who will be participating in the hearing 
with the parties prior to the hearing. Any witness scheduled to participate in 

Page 23 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

the hearing must have been interviewed first by investigators [or have 
proffered a written statement], unless all parties consent to the witness’ 
participation in the hearing. 

3. Alternative Hearing Options 
If a party or parties prefer not to attend the hearing in person, the parties 
should request alternative arrangements from the Hearing Officer at least 
five (5) days prior to the hearing. The Hearing Officer may arrange to use 
technology to allow remote testimony without compromising the fairness 
of the hearing. 

4. Evidentiary Considerations 
a. Except for the evidentiary prohibitions set forth below, any 
evidence that the Hearing Officer believes is relevant and 
credible may be considered, including an individual’s prior 
misconduct history, as well as evidence indicating a pattern of 
misconduct. When prior misconduct is related to the current 
allegations, the prior misconduct may be considered at the 
findings stage of the process; unrelated prior misconduct (e.g. 
alcohol abuse) will only be considered during sanctioning. The 
Hearing Officer may exclude irrelevant or immaterial evidence 
and may choose to disregard evidence lacking in credibility or 
that is improperly prejudicial. 
b. While previous conduct violations by the respondent are not 
generally admissible as information supporting the current 
allegation, the investigator(s) may, after a determination of 
responsibility is made that may result in sanctions, supply the 
Hearing Officer with information about previous misconduct, 
good faith allegations, and/or findings, when that information 
suggests a potential pattern and/or predatory conduct. 
c. Previous disciplinary action of any kind involving the respondent 
may be considered in determining the appropriate sanction, 
because the Institution uses a progressive discipline system. 
d. The Hearing Officer renders a determination based on the 
preponderance of the evidence, i.e., whether it is more likely 
than not that the respondent violated policy. 
5. Evidentiary Prohibitions 
The Hearing Officer shall not consider certain evidence, including: 

a. Questions and evidence about the Complainant’s sexual 
predisposition or prior sexual behavior. Such questions and 
evidence are not relevant, unless such questions and evidence 
about the Complainant’s prior sexual behavior are offered to 
prove that someone other than the respondent committed the 
conduct alleged by the complainant, or if the questions and 
Page 24 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

evidence concern specific incidents of the complainant’s prior 
sexual behavior with respect to the respondent and are offered 
to prove consent. 

b. Questions or evidence that constitute, or seek disclosure of, 
information protected under a legally recognized privilege, unless 
the person holding such privilege has waived the privilege.. 
6. Hearing Procedures 
Hearings will usually be convened at least 10-days days from the 
completion of the final investigative report and will be conducted in 
private. Participants will include the Hearing Officer, investigator(s) who 
conducted the investigation, the Complainant and Respondent 
organizational representatives when an organization is the respondent), 
advisors and support person to the parties (the parties may have up to 
two people present, one advisor and one support person), and any called 
witnesses. 

a. Investigator Presents the Report 
i. The Hearing Officer explains the procedures and 
introduces the participants. 
ii. The investigator(s) will then present the report of the 
investigation and will be subject to questioning by the 
Hearing Officer and parties. The investigator(s) will be 
present during the entire hearing process. Once the 
investigator(s) present their report and are questioned, 
the parties may provide relevant information in turn and 
the Hearing Officer will permit questioning of the parties 
and witnesses through the respective Advisors. 
b. Participation in Hearing 
The Complainant and Respondent have the right to be present at 
the hearing. If, despite being notified of the date, time, and 
location of the hearing, any party is not in attendance, the 
hearing may proceed as described below. Neither party is 
required to participate in the hearing in order for the hearing to 
proceed. Investigators will be present, unless the Hearing Officer 
permits an absence under extenuating circumstances. 

c. Questioning 
i. Questioning will be permitted of investigators, parties, 
and witnesses by the advisors to each party and the 
Hearing Officer, including cross examination contesting 
a party’s or witness’s credibility. Direct cross 
examination by the parties is prohibited; the party’s 
advisor must conduct the cross-examination on behalf of 
that party. 
Page 25 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

ii. The Hearing Officer has absolute discretion to determine 
which questions are relevant to the determination and 
may decline to permit certain questions. 
iii. The Hearing Officer may direct that certain live 
questions, once posed, are not appropriate and should 
not be answered. In such instances, the Hearing Officer 
will provide the questioning advisor with a rationale for 
their exclusion of the specific question(s). The Hearing 
Officer is responsible for ensuring that neither abusive 
nor inappropriate questioning occurs. The Hearing 
Officer will explain, on the record, the reason any 
question has been determined not appropriate to be 
answered. 
iv. The Hearing Officer may consult with the College’s 
General Counsel, when needed, to help assess the 
appropriateness of specific questions. If any party or 
advisor is disrespectful of or disruptive to the 
proceedings, the Hearing Officer will take actions they 
deem appropriate to preserve appropriate decorum. 
d. Evidence Presented at the Hearing 
i. Formal rules of evidence do not apply. Any evidence that 
the Hearing Officer believes is relevant and credible may 
be considered, except for the prohibitions stated in this 
procedure. The Hearing Officer is responsible for 
addressing any evidentiary concerns prior to and/or 
during the hearing, may exclude irrelevant or immaterial 
evidence, and may disregard evidence lacking in 
credibility or that is improperly prejudicial. The Hearing 
Officer will determine all questions of procedure and 
evidence. Anyone appearing at the hearing to provide 
information will respond to questions on their own behalf. 
An advisor is not permitted to answer questions on 
behalf of the party. 
ii. Unless the Hearing Officer determines it is appropriate, 
no one will present information or raise questions 
concerning: (1) incidents not directly related to the 
possible violation, unless they evidence a pattern, (2) the 
sexual history of the Complainant (though there may be 
a limited exception with respect to pattern, the sexual 
history between the parties, or where evidence regarding 
the Complainant’s sexual history is offered to prove that 
someone other than the Respondent engaged in the 
reported misconduct), if relevant, (3) or the character of 
the parties. While previous conduct violations by the 
respondent are not generally admissible as information 
about the present allegation, the investigators may supply 
the Hearing Officer with information about previous findings 
to consider as possible evidence of pattern and/or predatory 
conduct. 
Page 26 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

iii. There will be no observers in the hearing unless an 
exception is granted by the Hearing Officer. The Hearing 
Officer will allow witnesses who have relevant 
information to attend only the portion of the hearing 
where that witness is responding to specific questions 
from the Hearing Officer or the parties involved, and then 
be excused. 
iv. In hearings involving more than one Respondent or in 
which two (2) or more complainant’s have accused the 
same individual of substantially similar conduct, the 
standard procedure will be to hear the allegations jointly; 
however, the Title IX Coordinator may permit the 
investigation and/or hearings pertinent to each 
Complainant to be conducted separately, if there is a 
compelling reason to do so. In joint hearings, separate 
determinations of responsibility will be made for each 
Respondent. 
v. Hearings (except for deliberations) are recorded for 
purposes of review in the event of an appeal. The parties 
may not record the proceedings and no other 
unauthorized recordings are permitted. The Hearing 
Officer, the parties, their advisors and appropriate 
administrative officers of the College will be allowed to 
listen to the recording in a controlled environment 
determined by the Title IX Coordinator. No person will be 
given or be allowed to make a copy of the recording 
without permission of the Title IX Coordinator. 
e. Deliberation and Determination of Outcome 
i. The Hearing Officer will deliberate in closed session to 
determine whether the respondent is responsible or not 
responsible for the policy violation(s) in question. The 
Hearing Officer will base the determination(s) on a 
preponderance of the evidence (i.e. whether it is more 
likely than not that the respondent committed each 
alleged violation). 
ii. If the Hearing Officer concludes that there has been a 
violation of the College’s 31001-Sexual Misconduct 
Policy, the final determination and implementation of 
sanctions will be formulated in consultation with the 
appropriate administrators/disciplinary authority: 
a) The Hearing Officer and The Director of 
Employee and Labor Relations and the Chief 
Human Resources Officer (for matters where the 
Respondent is an employee), or 
b) The Hearing Officer and the appropriate Dean of 
Student Affairs (for matters where the 
Page 27 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

Respondent is a student). 

iii. All sanctions shall be consistent with the College’s 
applicable policies, depending on the identity of the 
Respondent. 
a) Students: Student Code of Conduct (42001) 
b) Employees: the College’s Disciplinary Action 
and Suspension Policy (34002/32002CP), the 
College’s Discharge of Administrators and Staff 
Policy (34003/34003CP), the Personnel 
Grievance Process for Non-Bargaining Staff 
(34101/34101CP), the grievance procedure 
under applicable collective bargaining 
procedures, or any other applicable processes. 
f. Notice of Outcome 
i. The Hearing Officer will then prepare a written 
deliberation report and deliver it to the Title IX 
Coordinator, detailing the finding, the information used in 
support of its recommendation, and any information the 
Hearing Officer excluded from its consideration and why. 
The report should conclude with any sanctions. 
ii. The Hearing Officer, using the deliberation report, will 
prepare a letter of outcome and will share the letter with 
the parties, including the final determination and 
applicable sanction(s), within three (3) days of sending 
the deliberative report to the Title IX Coordinator. The 
letter of outcome will be shared with the parties without 
significant time delay between notifications. Notification 
will be made in writing and may be delivered by one or 
more of the following methods: in person, mailed to the 
local or permanent address of the parties as indicated in 
official Institution records, or emailed to the parties’ 
Institution-issued email account. Once mailed, emailed 
and/or received in-person, notice will be presumptively 
delivered. The letter of outcome will contain the following 
information: 
a) Identify the specific policy(ies) reported to have 
been violated, including the relevant policy 
section; 
b) a description of the procedural steps taken by 
the College from the receipt of the misconduct 
report to the determination, including any and all 
notifications to the parties, interviews with 
parties, and witnesses, site visits, methods used 
to obtain evidence, and hearings held. 
c) specify the finding on each alleged policy 
violation; the findings of fact that support the 
determination; conclusions regarding the 
application of the relevant policy to the facts at 
Page 28 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

issue; a statement of, and rationale for, the 
result of each allegation to the extent the 
College is permitted to share such information 
under state or federal law; 

d) any corrective actions issued which the College 
is permitted to share according to state or 
federal law; and any remedies provided to the 
complainant designed to ensure access to the 
College’s educational program or activity, to the 
extent the College is permitted to share such 
information under state or federal law; and 
e) the notification will also include information on 
when the results are considered by the College 
to be final, any changes that occur prior to 
finalization, and the relevant procedures and 
bases for any appeals options that are available. 
VII. Appeals 
A. Both parties have an opportunity to appeal from a determination regarding 
responsibility, and from the College’s dismissal of a formal complaint or any 
allegations therein. 
B. An appeal must be filed within ten (10) business days after notice of dismissal or 
notice of outcome. After this ten-day timeframe, the right to appeal has been 
waived. 
C. The grounds for appeal are limited to: 
1. A procedural error or omission occurred that significantly affected the 
outcome. 
2. To consider new evidence, unknown or unavailable during the original 
Investigation, that could substantially impact the Investigative Findings 
and/or Determination (a summary of this new evidence and its potential 
impact must be included in the written statement of appeal); 
3. The Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a 
conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents 
generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the 
outcome of the matter. 
4. The recommended Corrective Actions are substantially disproportionate 
to the severity of the violation or fall outside the range of sanctions the 
College has designated for purposes of its 31001 -Sexual Misconduct 
Policy. 
D. A written request must be sent to the designated Senior Vice President or 
designee, hereinafter collectively referred to as the Reviewing Official: 
1. The Senior Vice President for Administrative and Fiscal Services (for 
employees) 
Page 29 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

2. The Senior Vice President for Student Affairs (for students) 
E. The designated Senior Vice President may elect to serve as the Reviewing 
Official or designate another administrator to serve as the Reviewing Official. In 
any case, the Reviewing Official shall not have a conflict of interest or bias for or 
against the Complainant or the Respondent. The Complainant or the Respondent 
may submit a written request to the Reviewing Official, with a copy to the 
designated Senior Vice President, that the Reviewing Official excuse him/herself. 
The grounds for such request are limited to: (1) claim of bias, (2) conflict of 
interest, and (3) inability to be fair or impartial. The request must clearly state the 
grounds to support a claim of bias, conflict of interest, or an inability to be fair and 
impartial. This challenge must be raised within two (2) days after receipt of the 
Investigative Summary. The designated Senior Vice President shall grant or deny 
the recusal request within two (2) days after receipt of the request. 
F. Upon receipt of an appeal, the Reviewing Official or their designee shall notify 
the non-appealing person or persons, and the Title IX Coordinator. The 
Reviewing Official will provide both parties a reasonable, equal opportunity to 
submit a written statement in support of, or challenging, the outcome; 
G. The Reviewing Official or their designee will generally be limited to a review of 
the Investigative Report and evidence file (i.e., the materials collected by the 
Investigator in the course of conducting the Investigation), the hearing recording, 
the Hearing Officers deliberative report, the College’s 31001-Sexual Misconduct 
Policy, and any other appropriate College policy and the Respondent's and/or 
Complainant’s written appeal. The Reviewing Official, or their designee, may, in 
their sole discretion, ask the Title IX Coordinator, the investigator, or the Hearing 
Officer to clarify the Investigation report, hearing procedure and deliberative 
report, or remand the report back for additional investigation concerning any new 
evidence identified in the appeal or to assist in determining whether there was, in 
fact, a procedural error, if such Reviewing Official or their designee believes such 
an alleged error may have affected the outcome of the Investigation/Hearing and 
the Findings/Determination by the Hearing Officer. 
H. If the Reviewing Official or their designee determines in the course of their review 
that there was a procedural error that substantially affected the outcome of the 
Investigation , or that other circumstances exist requiring additional Investigation 
and hearing, the Reviewing Official shall order the Investigation and hearing to 
be reopened subject only to direction/supervision by and any terms/conditions 
imposed by the Reviewing Official (including, in any case in which substantial 
bias was present, appointment of a new Investigator or Hearing Officer). No 
disciplinary action may be carried out prior to the Reviewing Official or their 
designee expressly so directing in their Notice of Appeal Outcome. 
I. Within fifteen (15) days after the Reviewing Official receives the appeal, the 
Reviewing Official or her or his designee shall issue a Notice of Appeal Outcome 
either upholding the Hearing Findings and Determination and recommended 
Corrective Action of the Hearing Officer or remanding the case back to the 
Investigator. The Notice of Appeal Outcome of the Reviewing Official shall be 
final and will be forwarded simultaneously to the Complainant, Respondent, the 
Title IX Coordinator, appropriate Senior Vice President, campus Vice President 
and Provost, and the General Counsel. 
Page 30 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

1. In the case of an appeal involving a student (i.e., in which either the 
Complainant and/or Respondent is a student), a copy of the Notice of 
Appeal Outcome shall be forwarded to the appropriate Dean or to the 
appropriate campus Vice President and Provost. 
2. In the case of an appeal involving a staff member (i.e., in which either the 
Complainant and/or Respondent is a staff member), a copy of the Notice 
of Appeal Outcome shall also be forwarded to the Director of Employee 
and Labor Relations, the Associate Senior Vice President of Human 
Resources and Strategic Talent Management, the employee’s immediate 
supervisor, and other appropriate administrators. 
3. In the case of an appeal involving a faculty member (i.e., in which either 
the Complainant and/or Respondent is a faculty member), a copy of the 
Notice of Appeal Outcome shall be forwarded to the Director of 
Employee and Labor Relations, the Associate Senior Vice President of 
Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management, the Senior Vice 
President for Academic and Student Services, the Instructional Dean 
who has supervisory authority over the faculty member’s academic 
department, and other appropriate administrators. 
VIII. Implementation of Corrective Action 
A. If a notice of appeal is not submitted to the appropriate Senior Vice President in 
accordance with Section VII. above, the appropriate administrators/disciplinary 
authority shall act to implement the recommended Corrective Action as soon as 
possible, but no later than twenty (20) days after the appropriate 
administrators/disciplinary authority receives notice of the corrective action. 
B. If a notice of appeal is submitted to the appropriate Senior Vice President, the 
appropriate unit administrator/disciplinary authority shall act to implement 
recommended Corrective Action as soon as possible but no later than twenty 
(20)days after the appropriate unit administrator/disciplinary authority receives a 
copy of the Notice of Appeal Outcome containing the final recommended 
Corrective Action. 
C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where the Complainant or Respondent is 
an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the employee may 
seek review of the recommended Corrective Action (or, if an appeal has been 
filed, the Notice of Appeal Outcome) under any grievance procedures available 
under the employee’s collective bargaining agreement. If both Complainant and 
Respondent are employees covered by different collective bargaining 
agreements, the grievance procedures in the agreement that covers the party 
challenging the decision shall be used. If a Complainant or Respondent covered 
by a collective bargaining agreement seeks review of the recommended 
Corrective Action through the applicable agreement’s grievance procedure, they 
may not also appeal the recommended Corrective Action under this Procedure. 
However, a Complainant or Respondent may appeal a recommended Corrective 
Action under this Procedure and then seek review of the Notice of Appeal 
Outcome under the grievance procedure of the applicable collective bargaining 
agreement. 
Page 31 of 34 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31001CP 

If the Hearing Officer makes a Finding or the Reviewing Official makes a final 
written determination that there has been a violation of the College’s policy with 
respect to a grade awarded to a student, the Hearing Officer or the Reviewing 
Official shall make no determination with respect to the Corrective Action to be 
taken regarding a specific grade assignment. The Hearing Finding or final written 
determination shall be forwarded to the Complainant, Respondent, and the 
appropriate Dean, who shall select a review committee in accordance with the 
procedures stated in the Academic Regulations for the review of allegations of 
arbitrary and capricious grading. The Committee, which is established pursuant 
to 53001-Academic Regulations to review allegations of arbitrary and capricious 
grading, shall have no authority to reverse the Investigative Finding or 
Determination of the Investigator or the final written determination of the 
Reviewing Official, and shall confine its consideration to a determination of the 
appropriate Corrective Action with respect to the grade. The Committee shall, 
within twenty (20) days after appointment of the Committee and its receipt of the 
Initial Finding and Determination or final written determination, forward to the 
Investigator and the Reviewing Official, Complainant, and Respondent a written 
recommendation as to the appropriate Corrective Action with respect to the 
grade. 

Within ten (10) days after receipt of the written recommendation of that 
Committee, the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Senior Vice 
President for Student Services shall review the recommendation of the 
Committee and, upon completing such review, shall issue a final written 
determination of the Corrective Action with respect to the grade she or he 
determines to be appropriate for such violation (which she/he shall implement), 
and a copy of which shall be forwarded to the Complainant, Respondent, 
Reviewing Official, and Hearing Officer.

POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 31003 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 001 
Subject: Conflict of Interest 

I. The Board of Trustees recognizes that the continued excellence of educational programs 
and services at Montgomery College is dependent, in part, upon continued public trust 
and faith in the individuals who administer and operate the institution. It is the policy of 
the Board of Trustees that its trustees and employees shall not maintain, exercise or 
engage in relationships or practices that are illegal, could prevent or limit the objective 
exercise of sound ethical judgment, or have the appearance of preventing or limiting the 
objective exercise of sound ethical judgment. No member of the Board of Trustees nor 
any College employee shall engage in or have a financial interest, directly or indirectly, in 
any activity that conflicts, or appears to conflict, with his or her public duties and 
responsibilities. [The Board of Trustees' Bylaws also include policy statements relating to 
conflict of interest.] 
II. Montgomery College has been held to be an executive agency of the State of Maryland 
for purposes of the Maryland Public Ethics Law and the College Board of Trustees and its 
employees are subject to that law. 
III. The President is authorized to establish procedures to implement this policy with respect 
to College employees. 
Board Approval: September 21, 1987. 

Page 1 of 1 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31003CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 008 
Subject: Conflict of Interest 

I. Scope and Applicability 
The Maryland Public Ethics Law and the following procedures apply to all employees of 
Montgomery College. 

II. Purpose 
The mission of the College is advanced when members of the College forge links outside 
MC as scholars, artists, consultants, participants in research ventures, and in other 
capacities that relate to their professional expertise. Montgomery College encourages the 
development of such links, but also recognizes that these positive interactions can create 
the occasion for real, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest and commitment, any of 
which may damage the individual as well as the institution. This procedure is intended: 

A. To provide guidance that will enable these extra-College liaisons to continue 
while avoiding situations that could harm the individual and/or the College 
through the reality or perception of ethical, legal, or financial conflicts; 
B. To encourage members of the College to participate in such enriching external 
activities by providing a clear disclosure mechanism through which conflicts-
prone situations may be proactively shared, evaluated, and managed to the 
benefit of all parties concerned; 
C. To increase individual consciousness of the possibility of actual, potential, and 
perceived conflicts between private interests and public responsibilities and 
actions; and 
D. To promote continued public trust and confidence in the integrity of College 
employees. 
III. Definitions 
A. “Conflict of Commitment”: A situation in which an employee engages in an 
activity, paid or unpaid, that involves a commitment of time that interferes, or 
reasonably appears to interfere, with fulfillment of the employee's obligations to 
the College, even if the outside activity is valuable to the College or contributes to 
the employee's professional development, competence, or prestige in the field. 
Conflicts of commitment are a subcategory of conflicts of interest. 
B. “Conflict of Interest”: An umbrella term encompassing any situation in which a 
member of the College community has an interest or loyalty that directly or 
indirectly affects, or has the appearance of affecting, the individual’s professional 
judgment in performing any College duty or responsibility. 
1. Actual Conflict of Interest: A conflict that presently exists between the 
College’s interests and an employee’s interests or obligations. 
Page 1 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31003CP 

2. Perceived Conflict of Interest: A present situation where it could 
reasonably be perceived that an employee's duty to the College may be 
compromised by the employee’s other interests or commitments. The 
perception of a conflict may exist even when the employee’s interests 
are not actually improperly influencing the performance of official duties. 
Because the appearance of a conflict may undermine public trust in the 
College, perceived conflicts of interest must be disclosed and managed 
in the same way as actual conflicts. 
3. Potential Conflict of Interest: A situation that does not presently 
constitute or appear to constitute a conflict of interest, but where there is 
a reasonable possibility of an actual or perceived conflict developing in 
the future. 
C. "Employee": All full and part-time faculty members, administrators, temporary 
employees, regular status staff, and student employees. 
D. “Interest”: Anything of value to a person or organization, including a financial 
stake or benefit, an asset, a relationship with another, or a reputational interest. 
E. "Relative": 
1. A College employee’s spouse or domestic partner per Montgomery 
County Code, Section 33-22; 
2. A child or parent of the employee or of the employee’s spouse or 
domestic partner; 
3. A brother or sister of employee or of the employee’s spouse or domestic 
partner; 
4. A grandparent or grandchild of employee or of the employee’s spouse or 
domestic partner; 
5. An aunt or uncle of employee or of the employee’s spouse or domestic 
partner; 
6. A nephew or niece of employee or of the employee’s spouse or domestic 
partner; 
7. A brother-in-law or sister-in-law of employee or of the employee’s spouse 
or domestic partner; and 
8. A son-in-law or daughter-in-law of employee or of the employee’s spouse 
or domestic partner. 
IV. General Principles 
A. Employees stand in a relationship of trust and confidence to the College. 
Employees shall act in good faith with due regard for the best interests of the 
institution, and shall comply with the principles of conduct set forth in this 
procedure. 
B. Although not all conflicting interests are impermissible, those involving the 
Page 2 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31003CP 

potential for self-gain or gain by a third party to whom the employee is related 
can undermine the judgment or objectivity of the employee such that the primary 
obligation to the College is compromised. 

C. Full and timely disclosure of conflicts of interest by employees protects both the 
employee and the College. Employees must therefore disclose to the Office of 
Compliance, Risk, and Ethics any situation believed likely to present a conflict of 
interest, as soon as the employee becomes aware of the relevant facts. 
D. To disclose a conflict, an employee must complete the Disclosure Form available 
at https://info.montgomerycollege.edu/resources/code-of-ethics-and-employeeconduct/
disclose-a-conflict-of-interest.html and submit the form to 
ethics@montgomerycollege.edu. The Office of Compliance, Risk, and Ethics will 
review the disclosure, evaluate the circumstances, and work with the employee 
and any other College official as appropriate in order to eliminate or manage the 
conflict (where one exists). Where no conflict of interest—actual or perceived—is 
found, the Office of Compliance, Risk, and Ethics will provide the employee 
written approval to proceed without further restrictions. 
E. Serious violation of the foregoing policy and this procedure, including 
1. Failure to disclose a situation which an employee knows, or reasonably 
should have known, may constitute a conflict of interest, or 
2. Engaging in an action counter to a conflict-of-interest management plan 
duly instituted by College in response to a disclosed conflict, 
shall be considered misconduct. Violations may be dealt with by prosecution 
under state or local law, by termination of employment, or by other disciplinary 
action, or by any combination of the above. 

F. It is not possible to list all activities that constitute a conflict of interest or an 
unethical practice. The following are examples of activities that may operate to 
limit an individual's ability to either legally or ethically perform assigned duties. 
V. Financial Interests 
The Maryland Public Ethics Law, codified at Md. Code Ann., Gen. Provisions §§ 5-101 et 
seq., applies to all College employees, not just those who must file annual financial 
disclosure statements. The Public Ethics Law generally prohibits College employees from 
having financial interests in or employment relationships (including consulting) with 
entities which have or are negotiating contracts with the College. 

VI. Restrictions on the Employment of Relatives (Nepotism) 
A. Relationship to another College employee is not a bar to initial employment at the 
College. However, an individual may not be assigned or promoted to, transferred 
to, evaluated by, or in any way accept employment in a department in which any 
form of supervisory authority is exercised by a relative of the individual. 
B. No employee of the College may participate in or otherwise influence the hiring 
process or any employment-related decisions pertaining to the employee’s 
relative, including decisions regarding retention, evaluation, promotion, salary, or 
leave of absence. 
Page 3 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31003CP 

C. The College shall not employ in any position, or engage as a consultant or 
contractor, any relative of the President. 
D. The College shall not employ in any position, or engage as a consultant or 
contractor, a relative of any Senior Vice President or a relative of the Chief of 
Staff/Chief Strategy Officer, unless 
1. the Senior Vice President or Chief of Staff/Chief Strategy Officer first 
discloses the relationship in writing using the Disclosure Form available 
at https://info.montgomerycollege.edu/resources/code-of-ethics-andemployee-
conduct/disclose-a-conflict-of-interest.html, 
2. the Senior Vice President or Chief of Staff/Chief Strategy Officer submits 
the disclosure to the Office of Compliance, Risk, and Ethics at 
ethics@montgomerycollege.edu, and 
3. after review of the disclosure, the President, in consultation with the 
Office of Compliance, Risk, and Ethics and the Office of Human 
Resources and Strategic Talent Management, provides written approval 
for the employment of the SVP/COS’s relative as described in the 
disclosure. 
VII. Restrictions on Familial Relationships Between Faculty and Students 
A. A student shall not enroll in a course section taught by a faculty member who is 
the student’s relative. 
B. In the event it is not possible for the student to avoid the class taught by the 
related faculty member, the faculty member shall immediately advise their 
department chair and dean regarding the relationship. After consultation with the 
appropriate vice president/provost, the department chair or dean shall: 
1. Appoint another faculty member within the same discipline to evaluate 
the student’s written work, such as essays, research papers, essay tests, 
care plans, etc.; and 
2. Appoint another faculty member within that discipline to evaluate the 
student's non-written work or performance, such as artistic 
performances, teaching practice, or clinical practice. 
C. A student shall not be assigned to a faculty advisor or counselor with whom the 
student has a family relationship. 
D. A College employee whose responsibilities at the College entail teaching or 
academic coaching of students under the age of eighteen shall immediately 
disclose to the Office of Compliance, Risk, and Ethics—per the process set forth 
in Section IV.D, above—any amorous or romantic relationship with the parent or 
guardian of a student under the employee’s tutelage. 
VIII. Private Tutoring and Other Services Offered for Remuneration 
A. No College employee shall tutor privately, for remuneration, any student who is 
currently enrolled in the College. 
Page 4 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31003CP 

B. Faculty and other employees whose work involves direct interaction with 
currently enrolled students: 
1. Shall not receive remuneration from those students for other services the 
employee may offer outside of their employment at the College. Such 
outside services include, but are not limited to: coaching or athletic 
training, private music lessons, and therapy or psychological counseling 
services. 
2. Shall not in any way utilize their position at the College or their access to 
MC students to promote, solicit, or develop any private client-or patient-
relationship with MC-enrolled students. 
Notwithstanding this restriction, a College employee who has a pre-existing 
professional relationship with an individual shall not be in per se violation of this 
procedure nor shall the employee be expected to cease the outside professional 
relationship with the individual, if that individual subsequently enrolls as a student 
at the College and the outside professional relationship does not otherwise 
violate any provision of this policy and procedure. 

C. A College employee shall not engage in private tutoring activities on College 
property, for remuneration. 
IX. Gifts and Favors 
No employee may solicit or accept, directly or indirectly: 

A. Any gift that would tend to impair the impartiality and independent judgment of 
the employee; 
B. Any gift that has significant value and that would give the appearance of 
impairing the impartiality and independent judgment of the employee; or 
C. Any gift where the employee believes or has reason to believe that the gift is 
designed to impair the impartiality and independent judgment of the employee. 
The term “gift” includes, but is not limited to food, travel, promotional items, and tickets to 
entertainment events. 

X. Prohibition on Undue Favoritism 
A. Undue favoritism occurs when a person who, by virtue of his or her position with 
the College, has authority to grant or deny College-related benefits, privileges, or 
rewards, but abandons professional judgment and confers such a benefit based 
on factors other than individual merit and qualifications. 
B. Conduct that meets the foregoing definition of undue favoritism is prohibited by 
the College. 
XI. Endorsements 
A. No employee of the College will cause, permit, or assist any organization or 
individual, to distribute through the College or through College technology 
Page 5 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31003CP 

resources any commercial material of a purely advertising nature, unless that 
material relates to identified potential purchases in support of College programs 
or operations. 

B. College employees shall neither be involved in any commercial venture on the 
College premises, nor utilize College technology resources to promote any 
commercial venture—which involves the solicitation, acceptance of orders for, or 
the delivery of any commercial product or services unless all of the following 
conditions are met: 
1. The commercial venture is for the benefit of the College or for a project 
that is sponsored by a "recognized" group or organization. "Recognized" 
groups or organizations are those which have approved charters on file 
with the campus Student Life Office or which have been duly authorized 
by the President. 
2. The procurement of the product or service is covered by either a written 
agreement between the College and the vendor or a purchase order 
issued by the Director of Procurement. 
3. Any profits and/or commissions will become the property of Montgomery 
College. 
4. No rebates, commissions, gifts, samples, or other considerations will 
inure to the benefit of any College employee. 
C. Although engaging in a commercial venture outside of College time and off 
College premises is permitted where it does not otherwise interfere with an 
employee’s duties to the College, no College employee who engages in such a 
venture shall imply College sponsorship or endorsement of a particular product 
or service, or otherwise trade on the reputation or goodwill of the College. Mere 
identification of the College as one’s employer is permitted, provided that such 
identification is not used to imply College sponsorship or endorsement. 
D. Appropriate College staff may provide references for services and items used by 
Montgomery College. Such references may only be furnished in response to a 
specific verifiable request from another institution, a business entity, or an 
organization. In this context, providing a truthful favorable reference does not 
constitute an endorsement prohibited by this procedure. 
XII. Procurement of Goods and Services 
A. College employees shall not recommend or participate in decisions or actions 
regarding the procurement of a specific product or service in circumstances when 
the employee, or a relative of the employee, has a substantial direct or indirect 
financial interest in the entity furnishing the product or service. Examples of the 
above include: 
1. A buyer ordering products from a firm in which he or she has a financial 
interest; 
2. An account manager authorizing the purchase of consultant services 
from a member of his or her immediate family. 
Page 6 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31003CP 

B. In the event that participation in decisions and actions such as those noted above 
appears unavoidable by nature of an employee’s position at the College, it is the 
responsibility of the employee to notify their immediate supervisor of the nature 
and extent of the employee’s interest prior to participating in any such decision. 
The vice president/provost or the appropriate administrative supervisor, in 
consultation with the Chief Compliance, Risk, and Ethics Officer, is authorized by 
the President to render a final decision regarding the employee's participation in 
such decisions or actions. 
C. Any College employee, with the concurrence of his or her supervisor, may 
withdraw voluntarily from participation in any decision or action which may 
conflict, or which may raise the appearance of conflict, between the employee's 
private, personal interests and the employee's duties to the College. 
XIII. Conflicts of Commitment 
A. Description 
A Conflict of Commitment arises only when other activities burden or interfere 
with an employee's primary obligations and commitments to the College. All full-
time faculty and staff members are expected to devote their primary professional 
time, and energy to their position at Montgomery College. 

B. Activities Which May Constitute a Conflict of Commitment 
A Conflict of Commitment may exist even if the individual does not receive 
compensation for the external activity. Such activities include employment 
outside the College, employment in a second position at the College (in addition 
to a full-time position), involvement with professional societies, community 
service, conferences, consulting, and business activities related to outside 
entities including start-up companies. 

C. Disclosure Required 
In general, where an activity overlaps with an employee’s regularly-scheduled 
work hours at the College, or often requires the employee’s attention during 
those work hours, the employee must disclose the activity through the process 
set forth in Section IV.D above, in the interest of transparency. 

D. Exemption from Disclosure: Prescribed Responsibilities to the College 
Faculty and staff members have prescribed domains of job responsibility, defined 
in their respective position descriptions. External activities—such as involvement 
in professional associations or affinity groups—that fall within the employee’s 
scope of work or directly advance the employee’s core responsibilities to the 
College are exempt from this disclosure requirement, as such activities do not 
constitute a conflict of commitment. 

Union activities authorized by collective bargaining agreements do not constitute 
conflicts of commitment and are exempt from disclosure. 

E. Outside Employment 
1. College employees may not engage in any other employment or in any 
Page 7 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31003CP 

private business that conflicts with duties owed to Montgomery College. 
Faculty may be assigned duties during those hours that the College is 
open. The assignment of specific hours varies from semester to 
semester and duties frequently require availability at short notice. 

2. Because outside employment may affect an employee’s performance of 
assigned College duties, full-time employees who engage in employment 
outside of the College are must disclose the nature and extent of the 
outside employment to the Office of Compliance, Risk, and Ethics in 
accordance with Section IV.D, above. 
F. Part-time Teaching at Montgomery College by Administrators and Staff 
1. Administrators 
An administrator may teach part-time at the College provided that all of 
the following conditions are met: 

a. The administrator must be appropriately qualified to teach the 
particular course. 
b. An administrator may not teach more than one course in any 
given semester or summer session, unless the course is part of 
a regular work assignment. 
c. The teaching must have the approval of the administrator’s 
supervisor. 
d. The part-time teaching assignment shall be made in accordance 
with the procedures of the relevant campus, and the appropriate 
dean has final responsibility for assignment of courses. 
e. If the teaching is a part of the administrator's regular assigned 
workload or is done during the regular administrative work 
schedule, there will be no extra compensation. 
f. If the teaching is done outside of the regular administrative work 
schedule, compensation at the part-time faculty teaching rate 
may be granted, with approval of the Senior Vice President for 
Academic Affairs. 
2. Full-time Exempt Staff 
Full-time exempt staff may teach part-time at the College provided that 
all of the following conditions are met: 

a. The person must be appropriately qualified to teach the 
particular course(s). 
b. The part-time teaching assignment shall be made in accordance 
with the procedures of the relevant campus. 
c. Compensation shall be based on the part-time faculty salary 
schedule. 
Page 8 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31003CP 

d. The part-time teaching shall be done outside of the individual's 
normal work schedule. 
e. Full-time exempt staff may not teach credit courses as part of 
their normal work assignment. 
3. Full-time Non-exempt Staff 
Full-time non-exempt staff shall not teach part-time at the College.

access to personnel information about employees. The investigator shall also have 
access to the educational records of students, in whole or in part. Personal information 
obtained from educational records of students shall not, however, be disclosed to third 
parties other than the College’s General Counsel, appropriate Senior Vice President, the 
President, and the appropriate administrative official(s) who might require access in order 
to conclude the investigation and implement a corrective action. Employees who fail to 
promptly cooperate with an investigation under this Policy shall be subject to disciplinary 
action. 

L. Complaint Withdrawal 
Complainant(s) may request the voluntary withdrawal of the complaint. The request shall 
be in writing to the chief human resources officer, or designee. A request to withdraw will 
not stop an investigation if facts determine that the College must take action. 

M. Interim Measures 
Based on the information gathered during the investigation, the College reserves the right 
to take appropriate interim measures designed to provide relief to the affected person(s), 
reduce the likelihood of recurrence, or address immediate effects of the behavior. 

III. Implementation of Corrective Action 
A. The appropriate administrators/disciplinary authority shall act to implement corrective 
action as stated in the report and recommendation or as determined by the chief human 
Page 4 of 7 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31006CP 

resources officer, or designee, if there was an appeal, or as soon as practical of the 
report and recommendation, or the appeal, if applicable, is finalized. 

B. If there is a final determination that there has been a violation of the College’s Policy with 
respect to a grade awarded to a student, the finding or determination shall be forwarded 
to the Complainant(s), Respondent(s), and the appropriate Dean, who shall select a 
review committee in accordance with the procedures stated in the Academic Regulations 
for the review of allegations of arbitrary and capricious grading. The review committee, 
which is established pursuant to the Academic Regulations to review allegations of 
arbitrary and capricious grading, shall have no authority to reverse the finding or 
determination of the chief human resources officer, or designee, and shall confine its 
consideration to a determination of the appropriate corrective action with respect to the 
grade. The Committee shall forward to the chief human resources officer, or designee, 
Complainant(s), and Respondent(s) a written recommendation as to the appropriate 
corrective action with respect to the grade. Every effort shall be made to submit the 
recommendation within thirty (30) working days; however, the Committee may 
reasonably extend this timeline at its discretion. 
C. The Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs shall review the recommendation of the 
committee and, upon completing such review, shall issue a final written determination of 
the corrective action with respect to the grade she or he determines to be appropriate for 
such violation (which she or he shall implement), and a copy of which shall be forwarded 
to the Complainant(s), Respondent(s), and chief human resources officer, or designee,. 
The Senior Vice President shall make every effort to issue the final determination within 
ten (10) working days; however, the Senior Vice President may reasonably extend this 
timeline at their discretion. 
D. Once the disciplinary/grievance process, including any available appeal, has concluded, 
whatever decision is made regarding the disciplinary action constitutes the final 
administrative decision of the College in the matter. The chief human resources officer, or 
designee, shall ensure that the Complainant(s) is appropriately advised of the resolution 
of such disciplinary action. 
E. No provision of this Policy shall be construed as a limitation on disciplinary action 
available under applicable policies and procedures. If an investigation is conducted under 
this Policy and no Policy violation is found, that fact does not prevent discipline of the 
respondent(s) under other applicable Policies and Procedures. 
IV. Alternative Dispute Resolution 
Upon mutual agreement of the complainant and the employee/labor relations administrator, or 
designee, a complaint may be referred to mediation. If the grievant and the College agree to 
mediate a complaint, the employee/labor relations administrator, or designee, shall select an 
appropriately trained individual as a neutral mediator to help the parties resolve a workplace 
dispute. 

V. Confidentiality 
The College recognizes the importance of confidentiality. To the extent possible, all information 
received in connection with the filing, investigation, and resolution of complaints will be treated as 
confidential. Records will be maintained in a confidential manner to the extent permitted by law 

Page 5 of 7 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31006CP 

and insofar as they do not interfere with the College's legal obligation to investigate and resolve 
issues of discrimination. Thus, confidentiality will be maintained except as disclosure may be 
required to be made: (i) by law; (ii) to individual witnesses with knowledge of facts relating to the 
complaint; (iii) to appropriate human resources department staff; (iv) to union representatives in 
the event the Complainant(s) and Respondent(s) are union members, and/or; (v) on a need to 
know basis to counsel, insurers, auditors, appropriate Board members and executives of the 
College. 
VI. Non-Disclosure of Genetic Information 
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits employers and other 
entities covered by GINA from requesting or requiring genetic information of an individual or 
family member of the individual, except as specifically allowed by law. 
To comply with this law, employees should not provide any genetic information when responding 
to a request for medical information made in connection with a request for an accommodation, 
including any leave of absence. 
“Genetic information,” as defined by GINA, includes an individual’s family medical history, the 
results of an individual’s or family member’s genetic tests, the fact than an individual or an 
individual’s family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic information of a fetus 
carried by an individual or an individual’s family member or an embryo lawfully held by an 
individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services. 
VII. Maintenance of Documentation 
Documentation resulting from the investigation at each level in the complaint procedure will be 
maintained by human resources, and is not considered part of an employee's personnel file, 
except to the extent that personnel action(s) result from the investigation. 
VIII. Retaliation Prohibited 
Retaliation against a person who has filed a complaint or against any individual who participated 
in an investigation is strictly prohibited. Any retaliatory action by any College employee or student 
against a Complainant or witness is prohibited and may be grounds for disciplinary action or 
dismissal from the College. 
IX. Good Faith Reporting 
Any individual found to have knowingly and intentionally filed a false allegation or provided false 
information may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. A complaint made in good faith is 
not considered false merely because the evidence does not ultimately support the allegation of 
discrimination. 
X. Time Limits 
Working days are defined as all days during the calendar year other than Saturdays, Sundays, 
and days the College is closed. 
The employee/labor relations administrator, or designee, may exercise reasonable discretion to 
adjust the time limits set forth in this procedure.

in person, by certified, return receipt requested mail to the address that is kept on file at the 
College, or via email. For purposes of computing any time frames under these procedures, where

Subject: Prevention of Bullying and Workplace Violence 

I. Montgomery College is committed to maintaining a working, learning, and social 
environment in which the rights and dignity of all employees, students, and visitors are 
respected. 
II. Montgomery College views bullying and/or violent behavior as unwelcome, disruptive, 
and contrary to the development and maintenance of a safe, productive and supportive 
work environment. Such behavior is prohibited. Employees who exhibit such behavior will 
be held accountable. Visitors who exhibit such behaviors will be removed from College 
premises. Supervisors, in conjunction with the Office of Human Resources and Strategic 
Talent Management (HRSTM), are responsible for ensuring that the College 
appropriately investigates allegations of bullying and/or violent behavior. Supervisors, in 
conjunction with HRSTM, are also responsible for recommending appropriate disciplinary 
action against individuals found to have violated this policy. 
III. It is the policy of Montgomery College to expressly prohibit bullying and violent behavior 
or threats of violent behavior against any other employee, student, or visitor on College 
property (including its leased locations) at any time or while engaged in business with or 
on behalf of the College. Montgomery College will not condone any behavior that it 
considers to be bullying or violent, including hostile, aggressive, and intimidating conduct 
and behavior that impairs another’s ability to perform that individual’s responsibilities to 
the College or to participate in curricular and/or extracurricular activities. Furthermore, 
reprisal or retaliation against a complainant, witness, or anyone with information about 
behavior in violation of this policy is strictly prohibited.

consistent with College Policies.

disciplinary action in accordance with applicable College policies and procedures 
(such as 34002, 34002CP, 34003, and 34003CP) and/or collective bargaining 
agreements. Sanctions may include any available disciplinary measure, up to 
and including, discharge. 
D. In the event a third party (someone who is not a College employee or student) 
violates this Policy and Procedure against a College student or employee, the 
College will take appropriate action within its control to address the conduct and 
prevent its recurrence, including but not limited to, contacting law enforcement, 
and barring the third party from the College’s property. 
III. Definitions 
A. “Bullying” is abusive conduct that is threatening, unwelcome, aggressive, hostile, 
intimidating, harassing, and/or unreasonable behavior that demeans, mentally or 
physically intimidates, or humiliates people either as individuals or as a group. 
Bullying is typically a repeated course of conduct but may occur as a single 
incident. Bullying can be conducted by an individual or multiple individuals. 
Bullying may, but need not, result in physical harm; emotional and/or 
Page 1 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31011CP 

psychological harm; economic harm; and/or reputational harm. Bullying is not 
limited to conduct between individuals with a certain relationship. For example, 
bullying may be peer to peer, subordinate to supervisor, supervisor to 
subordinate, and faculty/employee to student, among other relationships. 
Bullying includes, but is not limited to: 

1. Verbal/written bullying, such as ridiculing, insulting, verbally abusing, or 
maligning a person, either in person or in writing; making abusive, 
threatening, or derogatory remarks to or about a person; and/or 
attempting to exploit an individual’s known intellectual or physical 
vulnerabilities; and 
2. Cyberbullying, such as bullying an individual using any electronic form, 
including, but not limited to, the internet, e-mail, cellular phones, and/or 
other electronic resources. 
3. Conduct that amounts to bullying as defined here may, in appropriate 
circumstances, also meet the definition of other conduct discussed in 
31011 and 31011CP, or elsewhere in the College’s Policies and 
Procedures. 
Bullying does not include the following conduct unless the conduct meets the 
definition set forth above: 

1. A supervisor or any person with supervisory authority reporting and/or 
documenting an employee’s unsatisfactory job performance and the potential 
consequences of such performance; 
2. A supervisor or any person with supervisory authority administering and/or 
recommending discipline; 
3. A College employee advising a student of unsatisfactory academic work and 
the potential for course failure or dismissal from a program; and 
4. A College employee advising a student of inappropriate behavior that may 
result in disciplinary proceedings. 
B. “Retaliation” is the punishment of or an action taken against an employee or 
student by a College employee or agent for: (1) reporting bullying and/or violent 
behavior; or (2) participating in an investigation into bullying and/or violent 
behavior. Retaliation can include, but is not limited to, demotion, discipline, 
discharge, salary reduction, and certain job/shift reassignment. 
C. “Violent behavior” includes physical violence toward a person and/or property, as 
well as threats of violence, whether direct or indirect. Violent behavior includes all 
forms of physical violence, all stated threats of violence, and behavior that would 
lead a reasonable person to believe that someone may act violently. Conduct 
that amounts to violent behavior as defined here may, in appropriate 
circumstances, also meet the definition of other conduct discussed in 31011 and 
31011CP, or elsewhere in the College’s Policies and Procedures. Examples of 
violent behavior include, but are not limited to:

12. Committing an act or acts of violence; 
13. Engaging in overt physical intimidation and/or aggression.

where an employee performs any work-related duty or student engages in any 
curricular or extracurricular activity. This setting includes but is not limited to, all 
College owned and leased premises, rental locations, off-site locations where 
College activities occur, and locations where College business, curricular, and/or 
extracurricular activities take place. College educational and/or workplace setting 
also includes online environments that the College operates and/or provides for 
employee or student use. 
IV. Reporting Procedures 
A. Situations Involving Violent Behavior and Bullying 
1. If presented with bullying, violent behavior or the threat of violent 
behavior, aggressor, if possible, and notify the Office of Public Safety. If 
at an off-site location, contact 911 then notify the appropriate Office of 
Public Safety listed in IV, A, 4 below. 
2. If a threat of violence is immediate, call 911 and provide all relevant 
details. After making the request for emergency assistance via 911, call 
the Office of Public Safety and provide all relevant details, including 
current location so that a Public Safety Officer can be dispatched to 
obtain additional information. 
3. As soon as practical, employees shall report the incident to their 
supervisor or to someone in the employee's supervisory chain, and, if the 
aggressor is an employee, to the Director of Employee and Labor 
Relations (ELR). Upon notification, the supervisor is responsible for 
ensuring that ELR is notified. 
Page 3 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31011CP 

4. In cases where a student is the reporting party and the aggressor is an 
employee, the Deputy Director of Public Safety for that campus or the 
closest campus for off-site locations is responsible for notifying the 
Director of ELR. 
Westfield – TPSS 
GBTC – Germantown 
Community Engagement Centers – closest public campus 

5. In all cases where the behavior rises to the level of a crime, it will be 
investigated as such. If the aggressor is a student, the incident may be 
investigated as a crime and as a violation of the Student Code of 
Conduct. 
6. When reporting threats or acts of bullying or violence, employees, 
students, or visitors will provide as much detailed information as is 
possible and will, if requested, prepare a written report. 
B. Response to Allegations 
1. Upon receiving an allegation of bullying, violent behavior, or threat of 
violent behavior, the Director of ELR, or designee, will assess the 
allegation to determine whether the allegation falls within the scope of 
this Policy and Procedure and whether the allegation is supported by 
facts and circumstances. 
2. After reviewing all facts and circumstances, the Director of ELR or 
designee may, where appropriate and with both parties’ consent, attempt 
informal resolution prior to proceeding with the formal complaint process. 
3. When informal resolution is inappropriate, the Director of ELR or 
designee shall recommend disciplinary action or other appropriate 
administrative action. 
4. The Director of ELR, or designee, may place an employee accused of 
violating this Policy and Procedure on either paid or unpaid leave 
pending further investigation, depending on the circumstances of the 
complaint and evidence at hand. If the Director of ELR or designee 
decides to place an employee on paid or unpaid leave, the Director of 
ELR or designee shall comply with 34002-Disciplinary Action and 
Suspension and applicable collective bargaining agreements. 
C. Good Faith Reporting and Non-Retaliation 
The College prohibits retaliation against employees, students, and visitors who, 
in good faith, bring complaints regarding violations of this Policy and Procedure. 
An individual found to have knowingly filed a false allegation may be subject to 
appropriate disciplinary action. A complaint made in good faith is not considered 
false merely because the evidence does not ultimately support the allegation. 

V. Faculty Staff and Assistance Program (FSAP) 
Page 4 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31011CP 

A. The FSAP Program, which includes counseling and referral services, is available 
to all employees, and should be used to prevent bullying, violent acts, and 
situations occurring in the workplace in accordance with section 35002. 
B. Any employee who displays a tendency to engage in bullying and/or violent 
behavior, or who otherwise engages in behavior that the College deems 
harassing, threatening, and/or aggressive, may be required to contact the FSAP 
provider for assessment and referral for appropriate treatment or other services 
and subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 
C. A mandatory referral may be used only when the employee is facing imminent 
suspension or dismissal. A mandatory referral may only be made by the Office of 
Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management after consultation with the 
supervisor. If the employee chooses not to participate in the FSAP program, 
dismissal proceedings will be initiated. If the employee does choose to 
participate in FSAP, the employee will be required to sign a written statement, 
agreeing to an immediate referral to FSAP. Further, the employee will agree to 
sign a release of information statement allowing the Office of Human Resources, 
Development, and Engagement access to the following limited information: the 
employee’s attendance, cooperation, and progress as specified by the FSAP 
provider, after the assessment has been made. If the employee does not 
cooperate with the recommendations of FSAP, then disciplinary proceedings 
shall begin. 
VI. Education 
A. Education is a key element of this Policy and Procedure. The College will provide 
education and information, as appropriate, for students and employees to 
enhance understanding and increase awareness of the College’s Prevention of 
Bullying and Work Place Violence Policy and Procedures. Any mandatory 
education requirements will be announced and posted on the College’s website. 
The President is authorized to provide institutional leadership and guidance for 
developing educational programs to increase knowledge and share information 
and resources to prevent bullying and violent behavior, promote safety, and 
reduce perpetration of the conduct proscribed by this Policy and Procedure. 
Goals to be achieved through education include: (a) ensuring that all individuals 
are aware of their rights; (b) notifying individuals of prohibited conduct; (c) 
informing employees, students, and other members of the College community, 
including contractors, about the proper way to recognize and address complaints 
involving a violation of this Policy and Procedure; (d) preventing issues that this 
Policy and Procedure addresses, and; (e) identifying the necessary steps for 
preventing bullying and violent behavior and addressing its effects. 
B. Workplace Bullying and Violent Behavior Advisory Team 
1. The College will establish a Workplace Bullying and Violent Behavior 
Advisory Team and shall include representation from Facilities, Public 
Safety, Human Resources, General Counsel, the College Ombuds, 
Equity and Inclusion, and others deemed appropriate by the President or 
designee. The Deputy Chief of Staff will convene the group quarterly, or 
as needed, and provide periodic reports to the President as directed. 
Page 5 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31011CP 

2. This team will assist in promoting this Policy and Procedure by 
addressing bullying and violent behavior by reviewing best practices and 
college protocols. This Team will provide guidance in developing bullying 
and violent behavior prevention and education tools (such as incident 
reporting forms, pamphlets, guidelines, trainings and handbooks, etc.) to 
further assist in recognizing and preventing workplace violence.

part-time employees of Montgomery College within the employment environment. Many 
of these privileges are stated in other College policies and procedures. 
A. The College recognizes that employees expect privacy and freedom from 
coercion in all matters not connected with official duties, including choice of non-
conflicting outside employment activities, associates, dress, physical

forums or meetings in an atmosphere of civility and respect and without being 
subject to undue influence or fear of retaliation.

representative of the College's position as an institution. 
H. College employees have the right to perform job duties free from any obligation 
to contribute, financially or otherwise, or to render service to any candidate or 
political party.

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 001 
Subject: Employee Responsibilities 

I. The purpose of this policy statement is to identify some of the employment-related 
responsibilities of employees of Montgomery Community College. Many of these 
responsibilities are referenced in other College policies and procedures. This list is not 
all inclusive. 
A. To perform job duties in accordance with the employee's job description and 
other duties as assigned. 
B. To report to work on time and stay until the end of the work day; to comply with 
the time period established for meals and breaks; and to devote the entire 
working time, attention and energies to the business of the College. 
C. To work cooperatively with associates and accept additional duties or 
responsibilities during peak workload periods or under emergency situations. 
D. To arrange annual leave so as to minimize disruption to a work unit. 
E. To safeguard and/or properly use information, including confidential information, 
in accordance with College policies and procedures. 
F. To safeguard and properly use all College records. 
G. To safeguard all property, equipment, and information to which an employee 
gains direct or indirect access as a result of employment. 
H. To limit discussions about nonpublic College information to the work environment 
and to further limit those discussions to fellow employees who have a need to 
know requirement. 
I. To bring to the attention of the appropriate person or persons and superiors any 
real or potential breach in security, invasion or destruction of property, or any 
activity which might be detrimental to the College. 
J. To be a positive force for reason and understanding; to make a major effort at 
consciousness-raising to help others understand the true nature of racism, 
stereotyping, scapegoating and bigotry; to create an environment of reason and 
understanding consistent with the mission and goals of the institution; and to 
reflect this in the day-to-day operations of the institution. 
K. To recognize that the Board of Trustees has placed on the President the 
responsibility for presenting to the Board the representative points of view of the 
College and that the President is the official channel of communication between 
the Board and the members of the College community and to utilize such 
channels to bring appropriate matters to the attention of the Board, consistent 
with Board policy regarding "communications" in the Board of Trustees bylaws.

POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 31104 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 001 
Subject: Political Activity—President; Designated College Officials 

I. The President is the principal representative of the College to the community. This unique 
representative role of the institution is perceived in nearly all activities of the President and 
renders extremely difficult any perception that the President is acting as an individual, apart from 
the College, regardless of the circumstances. This is especially the case when the President is 
acting in a public arena or in a way that could be communicated to third parties (such as written 
endorsements, etc.) 
II. Although the Policy of the Board of Trustees with respect to Political Activity (31004) permits 
College employees to engage in political activities, generally, so long as such employees make it 
clear that their actions are an expression of their own individual feelings and do not represent the 
College's position as an institution, this liberal permission for employees to engage in political 
activities is not appropriate for the activities of the President given the perceptions of the 
President’s representative role. The President should continue to represent the College and its 
interests as an institution, including representation in such political activities as meetings and 
discussions with elected and appointed officials and taking positions with respect to legislation, 
budgetary actions, taxation and finance, and political questions (including but not limited to 
Charter questions). 
III. Accordingly, it is the policy of the Board of Trustees that the President be subject to and confine 
any political activities in accordance with the following guidelines: 
A. May not be identified with or become part of an endorsement committee or similar group 
for any political candidate or party. 
B. May not directly or indirectly state or declare in writing “support” for a candidate. 
C. May not attend fundraisers for political candidates or political parties (however, may write 
campaign contributions as an individual—of course, may not seek reimbursement of any 
kind from the College for such contributions). 
D. May not be involved in scheduling use of facilities of the College or otherwise involved in 
any meetings or programs of political candidates or political parties using the facilities of 
the College or any other assets of the College (each candidate may be directed to the 
staff person responsible for use of facilities or assets, where all candidates are given 
equal access on equal terms). 
E. May not comment in any mass media on any candidate except as otherwise permitted in 
this Policy; may comment on matters of interest to the College. 
F. May engage in educational forums and activities as authorized by the Board of Trustees. 
G. May encourage registration to vote unless done in such a way as to favor a particular 
candidate or political party. 
H. May represent the College as an institution with respect to political issues affecting the 
College, and may express support for positions that are deemed in the best interest of 
Page 1 of 2 


POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 31104 

the College. This representation may include oral and written statements and 
discussions with elected and appointed officials and other members of the community, 
including the mass media, taking and advocating positions with respect to political issues, 
including but not limited to proposed or needed legislation, budget, taxation and finance 
actions, actions related to constitutional and charter questions and all other political 
matters and actions that may affect the College as an institution and the ability of the 
College to perform its mission in the community. 

IV. In addition, the President is authorized to designate certain College officials and employees 
(“Designated Officials”) who because of their unique positions and authority are similarly unable 
to act as individuals in political activities without being perceived as also acting as representatives 
of the College. The President may implement guidelines for the political activities of these 
Designated Officials that are no more stringent than guidelines applicable to the President under 
this Policy, but may be less restrictive and may be unique to a particular position or positions. 
V. The President is authorized to establish procedures to implement this policy. 
Effective Date: December 10, 2001. 
Modification Date(s): n/a 
Last Review Date: October 14, 2024.

POLICY Board of Trustees – Montgomery College 31105 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 001 
Subject: Medical Examinations and Fitness for Duty 

I. Montgomery College is committed to providing a safe workplace for the benefit of the 
College community. In order to provide a safe work environment, employees must be 
able to perform their job duties in a safe, secure, productive, and effective manner. 
Employees who are not fit for duty may present a safety hazard to the employee, other 
employees, students, and others. 
II. It is the policy of Montgomery College that the College may require current employees to 
undergo a medical examination to determine the employee’s fitness for duty under limited 
circumstances to ensure the safety of the employee, other employees, students, the 
College, or the public. The College will cover the evaluation costs of any mandated 
referrals the College makes to a licensed physician or mental health provider. Any such 
medical examinations must be conducted in full compliance with applicable law, including 
the American with Disabilities Act. Medical examinations shall not be used as a substitute 
for disciplinary action. The President will provide notification to the Board of Trustees of 
any medical examination initiated pursuant to this policy. 
III. Nothing in this policy supersedes or alters the policies set forth in 32106-Employment of 
Individuals with Disabilities or 35004-Leave Program. 
IV. The President is authorized and directed to establish procedures necessary to implement 
this policy. 
Board Approval: January 24, 2018

PROCEDURE – Montgomery College 31105CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 004 
Subject: Medical Examinations and Fitness for Duty 

I. Purpose and Scope 
A. The purpose of these procedures is to: 
1. Ensure that applicants and employees possess the requirements 
expected, described within the position that are necessary to perform the 
essential functions of the job, or noted elsewhere in College Policies and 
Procedures. 
2. Evaluate an employee’s fitness for duty when an employee is: 
a. Having observable difficulty performing work duties in a manner 
that is safe for the employee, other employees, students, the 
College, or the public; or 
b. Posing an imminent and serious safety threat to the employee or 
to others. 
3. Protect employees, students, visitors, and College property. 
B. A medical examination is defined as a procedure or test that seeks information 
about an individual’s physical or mental impairments or health related to the 
employee’s essential job functions. 
C. These procedures apply to all applicants and current employees. 
D. If the College requires a medical examination under these procedures, the 
College will pay for the medical examination. 
E. Nothing in these procedures supersedes or alters the procedures set forth in 
32106CP-Employment of Individuals with Disabilities or 35004CP-Leave 
Program. 
II. Requirements for Applicants 
A. The College may not ask disability-related questions or require medical 
examinations before offering a job to an applicant. The College may, however, 
ask about an applicant’s ability to perform specific job functions, state the 
physical requirements of a job, ask if an applicant can satisfy the job’s physical 
requirements, ask about an applicant’s non-medical qualifications and skills; and 
ask applicants to describe or demonstrate how they would perform job tasks. 
B. An applicant for employment to whom a conditional job offer has been made, 
may be required to take a medical examination to establish the applicant’s fitness 
to perform the job(s) for which the applicant has been extended an offer without 
endangering the health and safety of the applicant or others. If management 
Page 1 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31105CP 

determines that an examination is appropriate to a particular position, all 
applicants for the job to whom a conditional offer of employment has been made 
must be examined. 

C. If an applicant refuses or fails to participate in a required medical examination 
that is given under established standards and guidelines, refuses or fails to 
provide medical records, or submits inaccurate or falsified medical forms or 
records, the College may withdraw the conditional job offer and not consider the 
applicant for employment for that job. 
III. Requirements for Current Employees 
A. An employee may be required to have a medical examination when the 
examination is job-related and consistent with business necessity (i.e., 
successful operational functioning), as determined by the chief human resources 
officer. 
B. If a supervisor believes an employee has a medical condition that is affecting 
employee performance, the supervisor should inform the Chief Human 
Resources Officer or designee, and the Chief Human Resources Officer or 
designee may recommend that the employee undergo a medical examination. 
1. The referring supervisor may request a medical examination that is job 
related and consistent with business necessity, such as when: 
a. an employee’s conduct creates a reasonable belief that a threat 
to the health or safety of the employee or others, or to College 
property, exists; or 
b. there is objective evidence that the employee cannot perform the 
essential job functions. 
2. The grounds for seeking a medical examination may become evident 
from a supervisor’s observations and/or receipt of a reliable report of an 
employee’s possible lack of fitness for duty. Observations or employee 
self-reports may include, but are not limited to difficulties with manual 
dexterity, memory, coordination, alertness, speech, vision acuity, 
concentration, response to criticism, interactions with co-workers and 
supervisors, outbursts, hostility, violent behavior, suicidal or threatening 
statements, change in personal hygiene, and/or reasonable suspicion 
(via odor or observation) of drug or alcohol use. 
3. The supervisor should consult in advance with the Chief Human 
Resources Officer or designee about how and whether to speak with the 
employee about requiring a medical examination. 
C. The Chief Human Resources Officer or designee may require an employee to 
discontinue work and undergo a medical examination when the Chief Human 
Resources Officer or designee has a reasonable belief, based on objective 
evidence that: 
Page 2 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31105CP 

1. the employee’s ability to perform essential job functions is impaired, or 
2. an employee poses a direct threat to the employee or others. 
D. If an employee refuses or fails to participate in a medical examination or a 
fitness-for-duty evaluation, refuses or fails to provide medical records, or submits 
inaccurate or falsified medical forms or records, the College may take 
appropriate disciplinary action against the employee up to and including 
termination of employment. 
IV. Medical Examination Procedures 
A. The College will select a licensed physician or mental health provider to perform 
the examination and report the findings to the Chief Human Resources Officer or 
designee. The medical provider conducting the examination shall have a clear 
understanding of the essential functions of the applicant’s or employee’s position 
and the working conditions for that position. The medical examination under this 
Procedure, and the information the College obtains as a result, should be limited 
in scope based on the reason for the examination. For example, if the medical 
examination is being required because of concerns that an employee will pose a 
direct threat, the examination should be limited to determining whether the 
employee can perform the employee’s job without posing a direct threat. 
1. The College will cover the evaluation costs of any mandated referrals the 
College makes to a licensed physician or mental health provider. If the 
applicant or employee selects their own provider, the applicant or 
employee will be responsible for the cost of the evaluation. The physician 
or mental healthcare professional selected to conduct the evaluation 
must be qualified to provide an effective assessment relevant to the 
evaluation questions at hand. The applicant or employee should consult 
with the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee before selecting 
their own mental healthcare professional to clarify qualifications. The 
applicant or employee will be asked to sign a release authorizing the 
healthcare professional to discuss the evaluation with the Chief Human 
Resources Officer, or designee. 
2. The Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee shall review the report 
and recommendations submitted by the applicant’s or employee’s 
provider and may seek a secondary evaluation from an independent 
healthcare professional of the College’s choice if it is determined that the 
professional selected by the applicant or employee does not have the 
expertise to give an opinion about the questions at hand, the information 
submitted does not specifically address the referral provided by the 
College, or there are other factors that indicate the information submitted 
is not credible or is fraudulent. This evaluation will be at no cost to the 
applicant or employee. 
3. The Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee shall provide the 
applicant or employee with a specified period in which to be evaluated. If 
an applicant or employee refuses to undergo an evaluation, does not 
attend the evaluation at the time it is scheduled, or refuses to provide a 
Page 3 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31105CP 

release authorizing the healthcare professional to discuss the evaluation 
with the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, any conditional 
job offer to the applicant may be withdrawn and the current employee 
may be subject to disciplinary action for failure to comply with the 
directive of a College official. 

B. The professional making the evaluation shall make an individualized and 
objective assessment of the applicant’s and employee’s ability to safely perform 
the essential job functions without endangering the health and safety of 
themselves or others, based on a reasonable professional judgment relying on 
the most current professional knowledge and/or the best available objective 
evidence. 
1. This assessment shall include a determination of the nature, duration 
and severity of the risk posed by the applicant or employee to the health 
or safety of others, the probability that the potentially threatening injury 
will actually occur, and whether reasonable modifications of policies, 
practices or procedures will sufficiently mitigate the risk. 
2. The professional will, with appropriate authorization, share their 
recommendation with the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, 
who will consider this recommendation in making an employment 
decision. A copy of the professional’s recommendation will be provided 
to the applicant or employee. 
3. If the evaluation results in a determination that the applicant’s or 
employee’s condition presents no significant risk to the health or safety 
of others, and no significant threat to property, to the lawful activities of 
others, or to the educational processes and orderly operations of the 
College, no further action shall be taken except as a result of sanctions 
resulting from a violation College Policies and Procedures. 
C. Upon receipt of the evaluating physician’s or mental health provider’s evaluation 
that the applicant or employee is a qualified individual with a disability under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, the College should follow the procedures set 
forth in 32106-Employment of Individuals with Disabilities, as applicable, with 
respect to reasonable accommodations. 
D. The Chief Human Resources Officer may withdraw the conditional job offer if the 
physician or mental health provider determines the applicant is not a qualified 
individual under the ADA and cannot perform the essential duties of the job or 
would be a direct threat to the health or safety of the applicant or others. 
E. If the evaluation finds that an employee is not a qualified individual under the 
ADA and cannot perform the essential duties of the job or would be a direct 
threat to the health and safety of the employee or others, then the Chief Human 
Resources Officer may initiate the appropriate termination process. 
F. An employee who is adversely affected by a determination under the Medical 
Examination Procedure may file a complaint under 31006-Equal Employment 
Opportunity and Non-Discrimination (for appeals of reasonable accommodations) 
Page 4 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31105CP 

or initiate a grievance under the appropriate College Policy and Procedure or 
collective bargaining agreement. 

V. Confidentiality and Use of Records 
A. Medical examinations paid for by the College and the examination records will be 
treated as confidential and kept in separate medical files, not in an employee’s 
personnel file. 
B. When mandating a medical examination, the College will require the employee to 
sign appropriate consent forms that permit appropriate reporting as to the 
employee’s fitness, recommendations with respect to fitness, and any limitations 
and restrictions placed on the employee arising from the employee’s health 
condition. The College will not disclose medical or psychological information 
without the consent of the employee or except as may be required by law. 
C. The results of a medical examination shall not be used to discriminate against an 
applicant or employee. 
D. When the College requires a pre-employment medical examination or other 
medical examination under this Procedure, it shall not request genetic 
information, including family medical history, of the applicant or employee. 
E. The College shall include the following language from 29 C.F.R. § 
1635.8(b)(1)(i)(B) when requiring medical examinations: 
“The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits 
employers and other entities covered by GINA Title II from requesting or 
requiring genetic information of an individual or family member of the individual, 
except as specifically allowed by this law. To comply with this law, we are asking 
that you not provide any genetic information when responding to this request for 
medical information. "Genetic information" as defined by GINA, includes an 
individual's family medical history, the results of an individual's or family 
member's genetic tests, the fact that an individual or an individual's family 
member sought or received genetic services, and genetic information of a fetus 
carried by an individual or an individual's family member or an embryo lawfully 
held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services.” 

V. Evidence of Freedom from Communicable Disease 
A. Requirements. 
It is required as a condition of employment that: 

1. Every person connected with a food service facility whose work brings 
them in contact with the production, handling, displaying, serving, or 
storing of food, drink, or utensils, must furnish all information, permit any 
physical examination and submit any laboratory specimens or test 
results that the College may require for the purpose of determining their 
freedom from a communicable disease in accordance with the 
Montgomery County Code. 
Page 5 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31105CP 

2. Center for Early Education workers are governed by the State laws and 
therefore must obtain appropriate testing and provide certification as 
required by law. 
B. Procedures 
1. The evidence of freedom from communicable disease, as defined by 
county or state law, may be in the form of a signed physician's statement 
or other official health certificate indicating that, by means of a medically 
recognized method, the person concerned has been found to be free of 
communicable disease at the time of employment at Montgomery 
College. This evidence must be submitted prior to reporting for work, and 
no prospective employee will be considered as employed until this 
requirement has been satisfied. 
2. All food service employees employed by the College, as well as faculty, 
staff, or students participating or enrolled in programs or courses which 
involve the handling of food, or the supervision of its preparation or 
serving, will submit evidence of freedom from communicable disease as 
determined by the College. 
3. The Montgomery County Code also requires that such persons be free of 
all communicable diseases and infected wounds, sores, or lesions on 
exposed parts of the body. Although no initial or periodic certificate is 
required, supervisors are held responsible for reporting suspected 
carriers and reporting them to the proper authorities for proper 
verification of their health condition. 
4. The Montgomery County Code defines a food service employee as "Any 
person, including owner or manager, who handles food or drink during 
preparation or serving, or who comes in contact with any eating or 
cooking utensils, or who is employed in a room in which food or drink is 
prepared or served."

POLICY Board of Trustees – 
Montgomery College 31106 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 002 

Subject: Consensual Relationships 

I. The College’s 
mission is supported by professionalism in student-faculty relationships 
and in supervisor-supervisee relationships. Professionalism is fostered by an 
atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. Taking note of the respect and trust accorded a 
faculty member by a student and a supervisor by a supervisee, all College employees 
recognize that they are presumed to make decisions regarding their relationships with 
students and supervisees that will not compromise this atmosphere of mutual trust and 
respect. Employees should be aware of the possibility that an apparent consensual 
amorous relationship with a student or supervisee may be interpreted or may appear 
(either now or at a later date) as nonconsensual and, therefore, sexual harassment. 
Further, an apparent consensual relationship may give to third parties the appearance of 
unfair bias or favoritism on the part of the faculty member or supervisor towards the 
student or supervisee. 
Accordingly, it is the policy of the Board of Trustees that its employees shall not maintain, 
engage in or undertake an amorous relationship or permit one to develop with a student 
who is enrolled in the employee’s 
class or supervisee 
who is subject to that person’s 
supervision or where an evaluative relationship exists, even when both parties appear to 
have consented to the relationship. As an example, this policy includes the position that 
faculty members shall not engage in a romantic social relationship with students who are 
enrolled in their class; similarly, supervisors are expected to refrain from dating persons 
they supervise or evaluate, directly or indirectly. 

II. The mere fact that an amorous or romantic relationship exists between two persons 
either one of which may be an employee of the College or is a student at the College, in 
and of itself, is not addressed by this policy nor is there any specific or implied prohibition 
of such relationships. It is only when such relationships occur in the context of the 
special obligations and power of faculty-student relations (where the student is currently 
in a class taught by the faculty member) or a supervisor-supervisee relationship that the 
concerns addressed by this policy apply, including concerns regarding appearance or 
real conflicts of interest and potential for claims of sexual harassment against the College 
and others. 
III. The Board of Trustees does recognize that consensual amorous relationships may exist 
prior to the time a student is assigned to 
a faculty member, as a member of that person’s 


class or is placed in a situation where the employee must supervise or evaluate the 
student. It is also recognized that such a relationship may exist between co-employees 
prior to the time when one of those employees becomes the supervisor of the other. 
Special provisions shall be made to appropriately accommodate such situations so long 
as these relationships are timely disclosed by the faculty member or supervisor involved 
and the purpose of the policy to avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts 
of interest is accomplished. 

IV. Education is a key element of this policy. The College will provide education and 
information, as appropriate, for students and employees to enhance understanding and 
increase awareness of the College’s 
Consensual Relationships Policy. Any mandatory 
education requirements will be announced and posted 
on the College’s 
website. The 
Page 1 of 2 


POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 31106 

President is authorized to provide institutional leadership and guidance for developing 
education programs to promote awareness about hate/violence. Some goals to be 
achieved through education are: (a) ensuring that all individuals are aware of their rights; 

(b) notifying individuals of conduct that is proscribed; (c) informing employees, 
contractors, and students about the proper way to recognize and address complaints 
involving a violation of this policy; (d) preventing issues that this Policy addresses; and 
(e) identifying the necessary steps for preventing its recurrence and addressing its 
effects. 
V. The President is authorized to establish procedures to implement this policy with respect 
to College employees. 
Board Approval: January 26, 2004; February 25, 2013.

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31106CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 001 

Subject: Consensual Relationships 

I. General 
A. It is the policy of the College that its employees shall not maintain, 
engage in or undertake an amorous relationship or permit one to develop 
with a student or supervisee who is enrolled in the person's class or is 
subject to that person's supervision or evaluation, even when both 
parties appear to have consented to the relationship. 
B. This procedure does not address or prohibit an amorous or romantic 
relationship between two persons either one of which may be a member 
of the faculty, an employee of the College or a student at the College, so 
long as there is not a faculty-student relationship (where the student is 
currently in a class taught by the faculty member) or a supervisorsupervisee 
relationship between them. Where there exists such a 
faculty-student or supervisor-employee relationship, this procedure shall 
apply in order to address, among other concerns, concerns regarding 
apparent and real conflicts of interest and potential for claims of sexual 
harassment against the College and others. 
C. The College does recognize that consensual amorous relationships may 
exist prior to the time a student is assigned to a faculty member’s class 


or is placed in a situation where an employee must supervise or evaluate 
the student. It is also recognized that such a relationship may exist 
between co-employees prior to the time when one of those employees 
becomes the supervisor of the other. This procedure addresses such 
situations to permit these relationships to continue but to adjust the 
faculty-student or supervisor-supervisee relationship to avoid conflicts of 
interest. 

D. For purposes of this procedure, an amorous relationship is a recent 
romantic relationship if it is ongoing or has been in existence at any time 
within the six months immediately preceding the assignment of the 
student or supervisee to the employee. An amorous relationship that 
existed more that six months in the past and is no longer in existence is 
not subject to this procedure. Examples of amorous relationships 
addressed and affected by this procedure include but are not limited to: 
1) A faculty member engaging in a romantic social relationship with a 
student who is enrolled in a class taught by that faculty member, and; 2) 
A supervisor engaging in a romantic social relationship with an employee 
who works for the supervisor and is supervised by the supervisor for 
purposes of performance evaluations and work assignments. 
II. Procedures 
Where the employee has, or has had a recent amorous relationship with the 
student or supervisee, the following procedures shall be followed: 

Page 1 of 3 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 31106CP 

A. If possible, the student should be counseled and advised in his or her 
course selections to avoid course sections taught by an instructor with 
whom the student has or has had a recent consensual amorous 
relationship. Efforts should likewise be made to place a subordinate 
under the supervision of another supervisor where the supervisor has or 
has had a recent consensual amorous relationship with the subordinate. 
B. In the event it is not possible for the student to avoid the class taught by 
the faculty member or for the supervisee to avoid the supervision of the 
supervisor, the faculty member shall advise his or her department chair 
and dean and the supervisor shall advise his or her supervisor of the 
present or recent consensual amorous relationship and the following 
steps shall be taken: 
1. The department chair shall appoint another member of the 
faculty to evaluate the student’s 
written work, such as essays, 

research papers, essay tests, care plans, etc. 

2. The department chair shall appoint another member of the 
faculty to evaluate the student's non-written work or performance 
such as artistic performances, teaching practice or clinical 
practice. 
3. When an appropriate instructor is not available to evaluate the 
student's work, the department chair will conduct the evaluation. 
4. A student should not be assigned to a faculty advisor or 
counselor with whom the student has or has had a recent 
consensual amorous relationship. The faculty advisor/counselor 
should request that the student be reassigned. 
5. A supervisor will request that his or her supervisor evaluate the 
supervisee employee and if such evaluation is not available, he 
or she will request that a supervisor of a related department 
evaluate the employee. 
6. The supervisor will recuse himself or herself from discussion or 
consideration of the employee for promotion, hiring or 
determination of salary. 
C. A College employee who fails to follow the policy set forth in 
subparagraph B above, and does not withdraw from participation in 
activities or decisions which may reward or penalize a student or 
supervisee with whom the employee has or has had a recent consensual

collaboration with the appropriate unit administrator, is responsible for making the 
final determination as to which candidate to hire and submitting documentation. 
Apart from forwarding details about open positions to potential applicants during 
recruitment, under no circumstances should a hiring manager communicate with 
any candidate outside of the formal process regarding the position to which the 
candidate is applying. 
B. HRSTM Recruiter: Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management (HRSTM)

dean (hiring manager) will draft a new position description or will update 
the existing position description. The position description is submitted for 
review and approval through the appropriate channels. HRSTM conducts 
the final review of the position description to confirm job title, rank, and 
salary range. A current, approved position description is required for a 
recruitment request to commence. 
E. Acting or Interim Appointments 
Individuals may be assigned to an interim or acting role. The manager of the 
vacant position will consult with their supervisor, the relevant administrator for the 
unit, and HRSTM if a vacancy is to be temporarily filled by an acting or interim 
assignment. In these cases, selection of employees to serve as acting or on an 
interim basis should be based on the qualifications of the employee and needs of 
the College and will normally be for no more than one year. HRSTM will monitor 
all acting and interim positions and work with the unit manager to develop a 
recruitment strategy and plan to permanently fill the position.

broaden the reach and scope of a recruitment. The use of an external 
search firm must be in compliance with the College’s procurement 
procedures and must be approved in advance by the Chief Human 
Resources Officer. 
3. The hiring manager, in consultation with HRSTM, may decide to fill a 
vacancy by the following recruitment methods: 
Page 3 of 7 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32100CP 

a. by conducting an “internal/external” recruitment, which is open 
to all qualified college employees and the general public; In most 
cases, position vacancies will be posted internally for a limited 
period of time before external posting to allow current employees 
an opportunity to express interest and be considered. 
b. by conducting an “internal only” search, which is open to 
individuals currently employed with the college, including regular 
employees, temporary with benefits staff, part-time faculty, and 
casual temporary employees both within and outside of the hiring 
unit. Internal applicants must be in good standing, as defined by 
the most current guidelines from HRSTM, Employee and Labor 
Relations, in order to be eligible for consideration. In most 
cases, employees must successfully complete the 6-month 
probationary period prior to applying for other positions, see 
Changes in Employee Status 34001CP. However, this may be 
waived by the Chief Human Resources Officer or designee when 
the determination is made that it is in the best interest of the 
College; 
c. by conducting a “division only/department only” internal 
search, which is open to all eligible employees within the hiring 
division or the hiring department. Division only/department only 
recruitments require the approval of the senior vice president 
who oversees the unit and the Chief Human Resources Officer 
or designee. Divisions or departments with positions that are 
placed across locations and/or with multiple shifts will normally 
require, at minimum, an internal or department/division search. 
B. Screening Applicants 
1. The HRSTM recruiter will screen all applications to determine which 
applicants appear to meet the minimum qualifications. The applications 
of qualified candidates will be reviewed by the hiring manager to confirm 
the initial screening and determine candidates to be forwarded to the 
committee, if relevant. 
2. The recruiter is responsible for ensuring an adequately diverse applicant 
pool. If the pool is determined to not be diverse, additional efforts will be 
taken to diversity the pool of candidates. 
C. Search Committees 
1. A search committee is generally recommended for budgeted positions. If 
a search committee is used, the search advocate will be selected from a 
list of trained search advocates in collaboration between HRSTM and the 
hiring manager. 
2. For administrator, full-time faculty position, and staff positions at grade 
31 and above, a college-wide search committee is required. The hiring 
manager will appoint members representative of the College 
community’s population, ensuring that the committee is diverse. 
Additionally, consideration for committee membership should include 
Page 4 of 7 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32100CP 

relevancy of departments/disciplines/areas of the college, types of role 
and responsibility, and location and/or campus. In some instances when 
subject matter expertise is needed or the position may interact with 
College partners, individuals who are not employees of the College may 
be invited to participate in the search with advance approval by HRSTM 
and subject to all search committee member requirements. 

3. A tiered interview process may be used in place of a traditional search 
committee format. In this process, a candidate will complete multiple 
interviews with different individuals. The hiring manager must consult 
with their supervisory chain and the recruiter throughout this process. 
4. If a search committee is used, the hiring manager may lead the search 
committee or may choose to delegate the responsibility and appoint an 
individual to serve as chair of the committee. The hiring manager is 
required to meet with the search committee to provide them direction and 
outline the parameters of the search. 
5. The hiring manager or the chair of the search committee will notify the 
HRSTM recruiter as to which candidates are to be interviewed by the 
supervisor and/or the committee. 
D. Interviews 
1. The purpose of an interview is to better assess and understand a 
candidate’s skills, experience, and background. The interview should 
also provide an opportunity for the candidate to gain a better 
understanding of the College, culture, and expectations of the position. 
2. The hiring manager and HRSTM recruiter will partner to review the 
parameters related to interviews, including teaching demonstrations, 
presentations, skills tests, writing samples, and any other relevant 
aspects of the interview process. 
3. A structured interview format will be used to ensure a fair and equitable 
process for each candidate and in accordance with interview guidelines 
from HRSTM. 
4. The hiring manager will ensure that interviews take place in an 
appropriate location that is accessible, equipped appropriately, and 
ensure that accommodations are provided for those candidates who 
request them. 
E. Selection and Documentation 
1. If a search committee is used, upon completion of the interview process, 
the search chair will submit a summary of the committee’s evaluation of 
the interviewed candidate’s strengths and weaknesses. 
2. The hiring manager, in collaboration with the unit administrator, is 
responsible for making the final determination as to which candidate to 
hire. The search committee’s feedback is considered by the hiring 
manager when making a hiring decision. 
Page 5 of 7

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32101CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 005 
Subject: Employment Practices 

NOTE: Conditions of employment regarding different categories of employees are located in 
various places in the policies and procedures. Requirements for specific positions are in the job 
description. 

I. Purpose 
A pre-employment or post-employment investigation of a candidate’s or employee’s 
background serves as an important part of the selection process. There are several 
purposes for background investigations: (1) to promote a safe environment for students 
and employees; (2) to protect organizational assets including people, property and 
information; and (3) to enable the College to make prudent hiring decisions based upon 
comprehensive job-related information. 

II. Responsibilities 
A. Verification of Credentials 
To the extent possible, all diplomas, professional licenses, transcripts, and 
certifications required for employment into a specific position will be verified at 
the time of employment. In cases where there is a question as to the authenticity 
or equivalency of a license or degree, an outside credentialing service will be 
utilized. Applicants will be notified of this requirement at the time of interview and 
will be responsible for obtaining the appropriate verification. This verification will 
be required prior to the start of employment; however, in extenuating 
circumstances the Associate Senior Vice President for Human Resources and 
Strategic Talent Management may grant an extension and allow employment to 
commence prior to their receipt. Continuation of employment will be contingent 
upon final receipt of these documents within the time frame stipulated. These 
documents will be maintained in the employee’s personnel file. 

B. References for Employment Applicants 
All applicants selected for regular employment by the College must provide at 
least three references to a hiring supervisor; these references should preferably 
include prior employers, but personal character references will be accepted as 
necessary. To the extent possible, verification of all the selected applicants’ 
employment for the previous five years will be obtained. If a current Montgomery 
College employee is starting a new job within the College as a result of a 
transfer, promotion, or reassignment, reference checks will not be required, but 
further references may be obtained at the discretion of the hiring supervisor. 

C. Background Investigations for Current and Prospective Employees 
Criminal history background investigations will be obtained through an outside 
provider for all positions where required by state or federal law, and for various 
classes of positions deemed prudent by the College. The College retains the 
right and authority to conduct background investigations on any candidate or 
current employee, for any position, as deemed necessary. When background 
Page 1 of 4 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32101CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 005 
Subject: Employment Practices 

investigations are required as a condition of employment, applicants or current 
employees will be so notified in the advertisement for the position, and will be 
required to complete and sign consent documents if selected for the position. 
Providing this consent is a condition of employment. Reports received as part of 
the background investigation process will be maintained in a separate locked file. 
Decisions on hiring a candidate or retaining an employee, based on results of 
background investigations where there may be negative information, will be 
made by the Associate Senior Vice President for Human Resources and 
Strategic Talent Management or designee. The decision will be based on an 
assessment of the risks to College students and employees related to the 
information contained in the report and the position for which the candidate is 
being considered. 

Montgomery College will be responsible for the payment of any fees in 
connection with background checks, and will reimburse the applicants upon 
receipt of the results. Continuation of employment will be contingent upon a 
satisfactory check. 

In cases where a background check conducted by an outside provider uncovers 
information that may disqualify an applicant from employment consideration, the 
Associate Senior Vice President for Human Resources and Strategic Talent 
Management or designee, will notify the applicant of the information together with 
such other information that may be required by law. 

D. Motor Vehicle Checks 
Background checks for valid Motor Vehicle Operator’s licenses will be required 
for applicants for all positions which require valid driver’s license to operate 
College vehicles, or any vehicle in which students are transported. This 
verification will be obtained prior to the start of employment at the appropriate 
State Motor Vehicle Administration by the applicant, and will be submitted to and 
monitored by the Office of Risk Management. Applicants will be notified of this 
requirement in the advertisement for the position. Evidence of a safe driving 
record must be submitted to the office of Risk Management every twelve (12) 
months. Employees with more than three points on their licenses will not be 
permitted to operate a College vehicle or any vehicle transporting students, if the 
record so compels such a result as directed by the Office of Risk Management 
with the guidance of the Office of General Counsel. The cost for the Motor 
Vehicle Operator’s License checks will be paid by the College operating unit 
where the employee is to be employed. Results of the background investigation 
will be maintained in the employee’s personnel file, and in the employing 
department if required by federal or state law. 

E. Inquiries Regarding Current and Former Employees 
All inquiries made by outside parties such as potential employers and financial 

institutions with regard to the employment history of present or former employees 
Page 3 of 4 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32101CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 005 
Subject: Employment Practices 

will be directed to the Office of Human Resources and Strategic Talent 
Management (HRSTM) for response. HRSTM will only provide dates of 
employment, job title and verification of the employee’s current salary. Additional 
information will not be provided unless the employee has provided a signed 
consent form authorizing the release of that information and the Office of the 
General Counsel has approved the release of such additional information. 
Written references will be released only through HRSTM and copies of such 
references will be kept in the employee’s file. 

F. Criminal History Record Information (CHRI) Files/Records Maintenance 
1. CHRI files/records are filed in and locked in a file cabinet out of public 
view in the HRSTM department. 
2. Only approved staff are allowed access to the files. Each approved 
individual will complete fingerprint supported background checks within 
90 calendar days of hire or transfer to a position/role which requires the 
staff member to access CHRI files/records. 
3. Only authorized agencies are allowed to view CHRI files. Identified 
agencies such as: MD State Department of Education (MDSE) – Office 
of Child Care (OCC), and the College’s Early Learning Center managers. 
4. All CHRI files are kept three (3) years after termination and then 
destroyed by shredding in-house or by a shredding company, pursuant 
to 68004-Records Management. The shredding of files is witnessed by 
staff member who is authorized to have access to CHRI files/records. 
5. Once a month Criminal Justice Information Services – Central 
Repository (CJIS-CR) Customer Service will be notified via fax if and 
when a College employee transfers out, resigns from the College, or 
otherwise is separated from employment. 
6. All personnel including technical employees who access CHRI files will 
complete Security Awareness Training every two (2) years or in the 
intervals required by CJIS. The list of employees approved to access 
CHRI files/records and their Security Awareness Training attendance 
records will be stored with the CHRI files/records and made available for 
future FYI and CJIS audits in accordance with CJIS Security Policy 5.1.

recruitment and hiring of a part-time faculty in one semester should not be 
construed as an indication of ongoing or future continued employment in any 
subsequent semester after the initial hire. 
C. The Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs (instructional part-time faculty) 
and the Senior Vice President for Student Affairs (counseling part-time faculty) 
must approve the appointment of any part-time faculty member, in any semester, 
who has not completed an appropriate master's degree. 
D. A part-time faculty member may be employed to deliver instruction or counseling 
through distance learning, remote classes, or in person on any campus or off-
campus location during the day, evening, weekend, or combination thereof, 
depending on the needs of the College. 
II. Recruitment 
A. The department chair, or designee, will work in collaboration with an HRSTM 
Recruiter to fill a part-time faculty vacancy. The HRSTM Recruiter acts as a 
resource by providing guidance and ensuring that the process is consistent with 
approved College policies and procedures. The recruiter is responsible for 
supporting the department chair, or designee, by facilitating the recruitment 
process through posting of job announcements, sourcing candidates, ensuring a 
broad and diverse pool of applicants, screening applications and forwarding 
qualified candidates to the hiring manager. The recruiter is the first point of 
contact for resolving any recruitment related issues 
B. The department chair, or designee, is responsible for completing and submitting 
the required documentation to HRSTM as outlined by the recruiter at the outset 
of the recruitment. The department chair, or designee, is also responsible for 
notifying the candidate of any training that will be required upon hire. 
III. Initial Rank and Salary Placement 
A. The initial rank placement process is maintained by HRSTM and is updated from 
time to time based on operational need, best practice and budget among other 
factors. Information on the current process and the current rank placement 
paperwork can be found on the HRSTM website or by contacting a recruiter.

POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 32106 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 003 
Subject: Employment of Individuals with Disabilities 

I. Montgomery College is committed to diversity and nondiscrimination and supports 
employment opportunities for qualified individuals with disabilities in accordance with the 
College’s Affirmative Action Plan for Veterans and Individuals with Disabilities, Board 
policy on Equal Employment Opportunity and Non-Discrimination, and local, state, and 
federal laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act as amended (ADA). 
II. The College is committed to complying with the ADA, as well as applicable state and 
local disability discrimination laws. The College will not discriminate against any qualified 
employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because of a 
disability, perceived disability, or record of a disability. Likewise, this policy does not 
prohibit the College from holding applicants and employees with disabilities to the same 
standards of conduct and performance as other similarly situated employees without 
disabilities. 
III. The College, in accordance with applicable law, will reasonably accommodate applicants 
and employees where the College is aware of a disability and the individual’s need for a 
reasonable accommodation so long as the individual is a qualified individual with a 
disability and provided that the accommodation is not an undue hardship for the College. 
IV. Education is a key element of this policy. The College will provide education and 
information, as appropriate, for employees to enhance understanding and increase 
awareness of the College’s Employment of Individuals with Disabilities Policy. Any 
mandatory education requirements will be announced and posted on the College’s 
website. The President is authorized to provide institutional leadership and guidance for 
developing education programs to promote awareness. Some goals to be achieved 
through education are: (a) ensuring that all individuals are aware of their rights; (b) 
notifying individuals of proscribed conduct; (c) informing employees and contractors 
about the proper way to recognize and address complaints involving a violation of this 
policy; (d) preventing issues that this Policy addresses; and (e) identifying the necessary 
steps for preventing its recurrence and addressing its effects. 
V. The President is authorized to establish procedures for processing requests for 
accommodations from qualified applicants and employees with disabilities in compliance

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32106CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 004 
Subject: Employment of Individuals with Disabilities 

I. Purpose and Scope 
A. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Americans with Disabilities 
Amendments Act (ADAAA) are federal laws that require employers with 15 or 
more employees to not discriminate against applicants and individuals with 
disabilities and, when needed, to provide reasonable accommodations to 
applicants and employees who are qualified for a job, with or without reasonable 
accommodations, so that they may perform the essential job duties of the 
position. 
B. The College shall comply with all federal, state, and local laws concerning the 
employment of persons with disabilities and to act in accordance with regulations 
and guidance issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(EEOC). The College shall not discriminate against qualified individuals with 
disabilities in regard to application procedures, hiring, advancement, discharge, 
compensation, training or other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. 
VI. Responsibilities 
A. Employees/Applicants 
1. A job applicant who has a disability and believes that a reasonable 
accommodation is necessary during the hiring process should contact 
the hiring manager for the position, the Director of ADA and Title IX 
Compliance, or the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, with a 
request for accommodation. An employee who has a disability and 
believes that a reasonable accommodation is necessary for the 
employee to perform the essential functions of that employee’s position 
should contact the employee’s immediate supervisor and the Chief 
Human Resources Officer, or designee, with a request for 
accommodation. 
2. Employees may communicate a request for reasonable accommodation 
verbally or in writing, however, the College encourages employees to 
submit a written request on the appropriate form with supporting medical 
documentation. 
B. Supervisors 
Any supervisor who is made aware of an employee or job applicants need and/or 
desire for a reasonable accommodation shall promptly notify the Chief Human 
Resources Officer, or designee, of the accommodation request. Supervisors are 
also responsible for assisting the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, 
throughout the accommodation process, including in identifying potential 
reasonable accommodations, implementing accommodations, and modifying 
accommodations. 

Page 1 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32106CP 

C. Office of Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management 
The Office of Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management is 
responsible for coordinating and administering the College’s Employment of 
Individuals with Disabilities Policy and Procedure and the Chief Human 
Resources Officer is the primary contact regarding this policy and procedure. 

III. Definitions 
Disability. A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life 
activities of the individual, a record of such impairment or being regarded as having such 
an impairment. 

Substantial Limitation. The determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a 
major life activity requires an individualized assessment, and an impairment that is 
episodic or in remission may also meet the definition of disability if it would substantially 
limit a major life activity when active. Some examples of these types of impairments may 
include epilepsy, hypertension, asthma, diabetes, major depressive disorder, bipolar 
disorder and schizophrenia. An impairment, such as cancer that is in remission but that 
may possibly return in a substantially limiting form, is also considered a disability. 

Major Life Activity. This term includes walking, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, 
standing, lifting, bending, reading, concentrating, communicating, breathing, learning, 
performing manual tasks, caring for oneself, and working. 

Qualified Individual With a Disability. An individual who can perform the essential 
functions of the position such individual holds or desires with or without reasonable 
accommodations. 

Essential Functions. The fundamental job duties of the employment position the 
individual with a disability holds or desires. The term does not include marginal or 
incidental job functions. 

Direct Threat. A significant risk to the health, safety, or well-being of individuals with 
disabilities or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by a 
reasonable accommodation. 

Reasonable Accommodation. This term means any modification or adjustment to a job or 
work environment that permits a qualified applicant or employee with a disability to 
participate in the job application process, to perform the essential functions of a job, or to 
enjoy benefits and privileges of employment equal to those enjoyed by employees 
without disabilities. For example, reasonable accommodation may include: acquiring or 
modifying equipment or devices; job restructuring; part-time or modified work schedules; 
reassignment to a vacant position; adjusting or modifying examinations, training materials 
or policies; providing readers and interpreters; and making the work place readily 
accessible to and usable by people with disabilities. Standards of conduct and 
performance are not lowered as an accommodation. The College makes the 
determination as to what constitutes a “reasonable accommodation.” 

Undue Hardship. It is not necessary to provide a reasonable accommodation if doing so 
would cause an undue hardship to the College. This term refers to an accommodation 
that would be unduly costly, extensive, substantial or disruptive, or would fundamentally 
alter the nature or operation of the College. 

Page 2 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32106CP 

IV. Employment Guidelines for Applicants 
A. Applicants should notify HRSTM of the need for reasonable accommodations in 
the application and interview process. Applicants should provide such notice two 
weeks prior to the interview date. 
B. Applicants will be provided reasonable accommodations to participate in the 
application and interview process, as determined by the Chief Human Resources 
Officer. 
C. An applicant shall not be asked if the applicant is disabled, asked about the 
nature or severity of a disability, or be required to take a medical examination 
before the College makes a job offer. 
D. An applicant may be asked about the applicant’s ability to perform essential job 
functions, as long as the questions are not phrased in terms of a disability. An 
applicant may also be asked to describe or demonstrate how the applicant would 
perform essential job functions as identified in the position description and the job 
vacancy announcement. 
E. After a job offer is made and prior to the commencement of employment duties, 
an applicant may be required by the Chief Human Resources Officer, or 
designee, to take a medical examination if all applicants for the job to whom a 
conditional offer of employment has been made are also required to obtain a 
medical examination pursuant to College Policy and Procedure 31105-Medical 
Examinations. 
F. Once an applicant has been hired, the employee will not be required to take a 
medical examination or asked questions about disability unless the Chief Human 
Resources Officer, or designee, concludes that a medical examination is being 
required based on objective evidence that the employee’s ability to perform 
essential job functions is impaired or that an employee poses a direct threat to 
the employee or others. In all cases, the medical examination must be job-related 
and consistent with the business necessity as determined by the Chief Human 
Resources Officer, or designee. 
V. Requests for an Accommodation by an Employee 
A. The College’s obligation to provide reasonable accommodation applies only to 
known physical or mental limitations. The employee is responsible for requesting, 
either orally or in writing, a reasonable accommodation from the employee’s 
supervisor or the Chief Human Resources Officer (or designee). An employee 
who requests a reasonable accommodation should provide appropriate 
documentation as required by law. 
B. At any time during the accommodation request process, the Chief Human 
Resources Officer (or designee) may ask the employee for medical 
documentation of the employee’s disability and of the need for a reasonable 
accommodation requested. If the employee provides documentation that is 
insufficient to permit the College to make a determination as to the appropriate 
reasonable accommodation, the Chief Human Resources Officer may require the 
employee, at the College’s expense, to have a medical examination performed 
by a health care provider of the College’s choice in order to adequately document 
the employee’s need for an accommodation and to and identify potential 
Page 3 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32106CP 

accommodations. Any medical examination required under these circumstances 
will be limited to determining the existence of a disability, the functional 
limitations that require accommodation, and identification of potential 
accommodations. 

C. The appropriate accommodation is identified through an interactive process 
involving the employee, the employee’s supervisor, and the Chief Human 
Resources Officer (or designee). Following receipt of a request for reasonable 
accommodation, the employee’s supervisor and the Chief Human Resources 
Officer (or designee), shall meet with the individual to acknowledge the request, 
explain the processing of the request, and discuss how the employee’s disability 
impacts performance of the employee’s job. In addition, the employee, the Chief 
Human Resources Officer, and supervisor should discuss the employee’s 
accommodation request(s), other potential reasonable accommodations, and 
should assess the effectiveness of the accommodations discussed. Throughout 
the process, the Chief Human Resources Officer (or designee) may consult and 
request the resources of other College offices, including the Director of ADA and 
Title IX Compliance, the Facilities Office, and outside agencies (i.e. the Job 
Accommodation Network and the Department of Rehabilitative Services). 
D. Reasonable accommodation requests are considered and analyzed on a caseby-
case basis. The College is not required to provide the “best possible” 
accommodation, the employee’s requested or preferred accommodation, or to 
reallocate essential job functions. The College is entitled to provide the 
reasonable accommodation of its choice so long as the accommodation permits 
the employee to perform the essential functions of the employee’s job in 
question. 
E. Where the disability, the need for accommodation, and the type of 
accommodation which should be provided is clear, and the accommodation 
would involve no, or insignificant, expense, the supervisor may agree to and 
implement the accommodation. Supervisors who agree to and implement an 
accommodation in such a manner must promptly notify the Chief Human 
Resources Officer, or designee, in writing of the supervisor’s action with respect 
to the requested accommodation. 
F. If the supervisor has questions about or is reluctant to provide the requested 
accommodation, the supervisor shall refer the request to the Chief Human 
Resources Officer, or designee. A supervisor may not deny a requested 
accommodation without first consulting with the Chief Human Resources Officer, 
or designee. 
G. After discussing the request with the employee and the employee’s supervisor 
through the interactive process set forth above, the Chief Human Resources 
Officer shall determine: 
1. If the employee is protected by the ADA, including, but not limited to 
whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity. In 
determining whether an impairment is substantially limiting, the Chief 
Human Resources Officer, or designee, shall consider: (a) the nature 
and severity of the impairment; (b) the duration or expected duration of 
the impairment; and (c) the permanent or long-term impact or expected 
impact from the impairment. 
Page 4 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32106CP 

2. If the employee is a qualified individual with a disability by determining if 
employee can, with or without a reasonable accommodation, perform the 
essential functions of the job in question. Whether a job function is 
essential is determined by considering the following illustrative list of 
factors: (a) the supervisor’s judgment on which functions are essential; 
(b) written job descriptions prepared for the job; (c) the amount of time 
spent performing the function; (d) the consequences of not requiring the 
incumbent to perform the function; (e) work experiences of past 
incumbents in the job; and (f) current work experience of incumbents in 
similar jobs. 
3. To determine if the employee would pose a direct threat to the 
employee’s health and safety or to the health or safety of others, the 
College should consider the following non-exclusive factors: (a) the 
duration of the risk; (b) the nature and severity of the potential harm; (c) 
the likelihood that the potential harm would occur; and (d) the imminence 
of the potential harm. 
4. Whether the requested accommodation would be effective to enable the 
employee to perform the essential functions of the job. The employee’s 
preferred accommodation should be considered, but the ultimate 
decision as to what type of accommodation will be provided, if any, is the 
College’s decision. 
5. Whether the requested accommodation would result in an undue 
hardship for the College. Among the factors to be considered in 
determining whether an accommodation constitutes an undue hardship 
are: (a) the cost of the accommodation; (b) the overall nature of the 
operation of the department or units involved in providing the 
accommodation, such as financial resources, the number of people 
employed and the effect on expenses and resources; and (c) the impact 
of the accommodation on the operation of the departments or units, 
including its impact on other employees’ ability to perform their duties 
and the department’s ability to conduct business. 
VI. Notification of Determination 
A. If the Chief Human Resources Officer determines that no accommodation will be 
provided, the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, shall inform the 
employee and the supervisor of the decision, in writing, within 15 working days of 
receipt of the employee’s request for accommodation, and shall set forth the 
reasons for that determination. 
B. If the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, determines that a reasonable 
accommodation is appropriate, the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, 
will notify the employee, the supervisor, and the Chief Human Resources Officer 
in writing, within 15 working days of receiving the employee’s request for 
accommodation. The notice shall include the nature of the accommodation to be 
provided and any follow-up actions to be taken. The employee will also be 
informed that acceptance of the accommodation is voluntary. The Chief Human 
Resources Officer, or designee, will also identify, in appropriate circumstances, 
the source of funds or other resources necessary to provide and/or implement 
the accommodation. 
Page 5 of 6 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32106CP 

C. The supervisor is responsible for implementing the accommodation and shall, in 
coordination with the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, monitor the 
accommodation’s effectiveness. 
VII. Confidentiality 
All medical documentation and reasonable accommodation requests, including those 
made using the “MC Request for Reasonable Accommodation/Modification” form will be 
maintained in a file separate from an employee’s or applicant’s official personnel file. This 
separate file shall be kept in HRSTM and shall be treated as confidential, except as 
necessary to administer the reasonable accommodation process. Accordingly, such 
documentation and information should only be shared with individuals involved in the 
reasonable accommodation process. 

VIII. Non-disclosure of Genetic Information 
A. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits 
employers and other entities covered by GINA from requesting or requiring 
genetic information of an individual or family member of the individual, except as 
specifically allowed by law. 
B. To comply with this law, employees should not provide any genetic information 
when responding to a request for medical information made in connection with a 
request for an accommodation, including any leave of absence. 
C. “Genetic information,” as defined by GINA, includes an individual’s family medical 
history, the results of an individual’s or family member’s genetic tests, the fact 
than an individual or an individual’s family member sought or received genetic 
services, and genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual or an 
individual’s family member or an embryo lawfully held by an individual or family 
member receiving assistive reproductive services. 
IX. Appeal 
If an employee does not agree with the determination and/or the accommodation 
proposed by the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, the employee may file a 
complaint in accordance with the College policy and procedures regarding “Equal 
Employment Opportunity and Non-Discrimination.”

PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32203CP 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 005 
Subject: Academic Rank 

I. Original Rank Assignment for Full-Time Faculty 
A. The rank assigned a new full-time member of the faculty depends upon the 
individual's degree status and his/her teaching and related professional rank. 
B. Rank assignment will be based on a point system: 
1. One point is granted for each year of full-time teaching in a college or 
university. 
2. One-half of a point is allowed for each year of full-time teaching in a 
secondary school. 
3. One-half of a point is included for each year of professional or industrial 
experience that is related to the faculty member's work at the College. 
4. Four points are given for an earned doctor's degree; three for a master's 
degree with 30 semester hours of additional coursework, if the faculty 
member does not have the doctorate; and two for a master's degree with 
fewer than 30 semester hours of additional coursework. 
5. For purposes of determining initial rank only, no more than one point 
may be added based upon exceptional achievement in teaching or 
related professional activities. A written justification of the fractions or 
point assigned shall be prepared by the department 
chairperson/designated supervisor and shall accompany the 
recommendation. 
6. A point sum that is less than 6 permits the assignment of instructor rank; 
a minimum point sum of 6 permits the assignment of an assistant 
professorship; a minimum point sum of l2 permits the assignment of an 
associate professorship; a minimum point sum of l8 permits the rank of 
full professor. 
C. Procedures 
1. The department chairperson/designated supervisor makes the initial 
recommendation for the original assignment of rank through normal 
administrative channels to the campus Vice President and Provost; the 
campus Vice President and Provost shall forward the recommendation to 
the appropriate campus faculty group, which gives its evaluation to the 
Vice President and Provost for action. 
2. The faculty member may initiate a request for review of the original rank 
assignment through the department chairperson/designated supervisor 
to the next appropriate supervisor. 
3. The department chairperson/designated supervisor concerned may be 
Page 1 of 3 


PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32203CP 

invited to take part in the campus committee's evaluation of the faculty 
member. 

4. Every effort should be made to assign rank prior to employment of 
members of the faculty. If possible, the prospective faculty member is 
informed by the campus Vice President and Provost of the proposed 
rank assignment at the time a letter of appointment is transmitted. 
II. Full-Time Faculty Assignment to Advanced Rank 
A. Before being considered for advancement in rank, a full-time faculty member 
must hold an assigned rank for a minimum of two years. After receiving an initial 
full-time faculty rank, a faculty member may be considered only for advancement 
to the next higher rank. Rank advancement is based upon the criteria indicated 
above. No points may be awarded any given year for advancement in rank if the 
faculty member receives an unsatisfactory performance rating. Points beyond 
those awarded for initial rank may be granted as follows: 
1. One point for each year in which the faculty member receives a 
satisfactory performance rating. 
2. Four points for an earned doctor's degree less any points previously 
awarded for a master's degree. 
3. Three points for a master's degree with 30 hours or more of required 
academic study (if the member of the faculty does not have the 
doctorate) less any points originally awarded for a master's degree. 
4. Two points for a master's degree with fewer than 30 hours of required 
academic study providing that points were not originally awarded for this 
achievement. 
B. Evaluations are processed through the campus Vice President and Provost for 
certification regarding points to be assigned. 
III. Original Rank Assignment of Part-Time Faculty 
New part-time faculty are automatically assigned the rank of Lecturer, unless a 
recommendation is made for advanced placement for meeting the criteria 
stipulated for that of Adjunct I or Adjunct II. The recommendation for initial placement as 
Adjunct I or II shall be made by the appropriate faculty and administrators and approved 
by the Vice President and Provost as designated by Senior Vice President for Academic 
and Student Services. 

IV. Part-Time Faculty Assignment to Advanced Rank 
A. Procedures 
1. Upon completion of a minimum of six semesters (may be nonconsecutive) 
and 18 credits and having participated in certain 
professional development activities, a part-time faculty member is eligible 
for assignment to the next rank. Each advancement in rank requires an 
additional minimum six semesters (may be non-consecutive) and an 
Page 2 of 3 


PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32203CP 

additional 18 credits and appropriate professional development activities. 
However, assignment is not automatic, but depends upon an 
administrative review to assure that minimum requirements have been 
met, and that the part-time faculty member’s evaluations have been 
satisfactory. The recommendation is initiated by the department 
chairperson/designated supervisor and is forwarded to the campus Vice 
President and Provost for action. 

2. For purposes of employment, all part-time faculty at Montgomery College 
have one official record. When evaluation of service is required, the 
campus at which the individual's service has been greatest will be 
responsible for initiating such evaluations. See the Board policy on 
part-time faculty published elsewhere in the manual for guidance 
regarding evaluation and other aspects of part-time faculty employment. 
B. Notification and Appeals 
1. The campus Vice President and Provost or designee notifies the faculty 
member of the assignment of original rank and advancement in rank. 
2. The faculty member should be made fully aware of the results of the 
administrative review at each step. If the recommendation of the 
campus Vice President and Provost is adverse to the faculty member, 
he/she will have the opportunity to appeal the recommendation to the 
Senior Vice President for Academic and Student Services.

PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32204CP 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 002 
Subject: Distinguished Visiting Professor 

I. No later than the beginning of the second semester of each academic year, each provost 
shall convene a committee consisting of the provost, an academic administrator, and the 
department chairpersons, or other faculty member. The purpose of the meeting shall be 
to determine, in priority order, the most advantageous use of a distinguished visiting 
professor for the campus for the following year. 
II. Following the development of the above priority listing, advertisements will be placed and 
announcements will be made seeking nominations for the distinguished visiting 
professor. A positive effort will be made to attract qualified minority, female, and 
handicapped persons, as well as others who may be qualified. The provost shall compile 
an appropriate roster of names for consideration for the first priority need from those 
nominated and those who apply. The criteria to be considered in the development of the 
list include: 
A. Demonstrably distinguished in the field of specialization identified. 
B. Capable of contributing to the overall development of the campus through 
classroom activities, seminars, workshops, forums, public lectures, consultation 
(within the campus), etc. 
C. Available for full-time service to the College during the term of appointment. 
III. The provost, with whatever consultation he/she deems necessary and appropriate, shall 
then select, from the list prepared, three individuals in priority order who in his/her 
judgment are most qualified for appointment to the rank of distinguished visiting 
professor. These names will then be forwarded for consideration to the President. 
IV. If approval is granted, the provost may then extend the invitation to the individual with the 
highest priority to accept the post. If the first priority cannot accept, then the provost may 
extend the invitation to the second priority person on the list, etc. 
V. Because it is anticipated that invitations to the post of distinguished visiting professor will 
be extended only to persons of distinction, and because the post shall carry the rank of 
distinguished visiting professor which shall be considered as equal to the rank of 
professor, the salary offered must be appropriate. Therefore, the normal procedures for 
initial salary placement may not be applicable. The entire range of the faculty salary 
schedule shall be available for placement of a distinguished visiting professor. 
Placement shall consider such facts as reputation (national, regional, statewide, etc.), 
past teaching experience and its reputation for excellence, quality experience in other 
than teaching posts, publications, research, etc. The recommendation regarding the 
salary to be offered shall accompany the provost's priority list of names submitted to the 
President. This recommendation shall indicate the rationale for the salary suggested.

PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32204CP 

VI. Each distinguished visiting professor shall be assigned to the department or other office 
of the campus where the need has been identified and approved. The assignment shall 
be for 20 ESH each semester of the appointment. This assignment need not, however, 
be a full 20 ESH of classroom teaching; rather, it may include special project assignment 
such as curriculum development, the conduct of in-service professional development 
activities for College and/or campus personnel, the preparation and conduct of 
workshops, seminars, forums, lectures, etc. at the College for the community and/or 
students and/or College or campus personnel. This assignment of special projects, etc. 
should not exceed 50 to 60 percent of the load assignment; thus, at least 40 to 50 
percent of the assignment would be in the classroom. 
Administrative Approval: September 21, 1987; September 27, 1990.

Board Approval: September 21, 1987. 

Page 1 of 1 


PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32205CP 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 004 
Subject: Minimum Educational Requirements for Faculty 

I. All advertisements for recruitment of applicants will contain a statement that a master's 
degree or demonstrated evidence of equivalent competency is required along with other 
specific requirements unique to each position. 
II. All applications received by the deadline date will be evaluated. Applications received 
after the deadline date will not be considered, with appropriate notification being sent to 
each individual. 
III. In the evaluation of applicants' credentials the primary criterion for hiring shall be the 
ability of the applicant as judged through such criteria as teaching interest and ability, 
commitment to the community college philosophy, related work experience, performance 
and/or academic achievements that meet the minimum position requirements. 
IV. In those cases where qualified applicants with a master's degree or equivalent 
demonstrable evidence of competency are not available, or in occupational fields where 
practical work experience is critical to teaching success, the Dean will make 
appointments in consultation with selected faculty in the curriculum. The following criteria 
may be used as acceptable evidence of qualifications: 
A. Have been awarded a professional degree beyond the bachelor's degree and 
with qualifications in specialized areas (e.g., law). 
B. Have been awarded a bachelor's degree and hold a current professional 
certification granted by a nationally recognized association (e.g., C.P.A. for 
accounting). 
C. Have been awarded a bachelor's degree and have at least 3 years current work 
experience in the field or directly related to the specific course(s) to be taught. 
D. Have other substantial qualifications which are consistent with the potential 
assignment and which will contribute to the goals, objectives and mission of the 
College. 
E. Have demonstrated competency through written and/or performance 
examination. 
V. Applicants who are hired without a master's degree may be required to earn a master's 
degree as a condition of continued employment. This condition must be stated in writing 
at the time of original employment. 
VI. Faculty employed in an academic discipline or professional area who desire to teach in 
another discipline/area must meet the initial employment guidelines for the other 
discipline/area unless special exceptions are approved by the Dean after consultation 
with the department. The qualifying alternative criteria will be noted and discussed with 
the applicant at the time of initial assignment. A faculty member who teaches in the area 
more than two semesters may be required to complete additional training as determined 
by the Dean. In cases where the Dean and representative faculty determine that further 
Page 1 of 2 


PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32205CP 

training/credentialing is appropriate, a professional development plan and time line for 
completion will be agreed upon by all parties. The following criteria may be used to 
approve appointments with special exceptions: 

A. Have at least 9 graduate hours in the other discipline/area. 
B. Have at least 3 years of recent experience in the discipline. 
C. Have demonstrated competency through written and/or performance 
examination. 
D. Have special certification/licensing in or related to the field. 
VII. The President delegates to the provost the authority and responsibility to implement and 
administer this policy and procedures and to prepare an annual report for the President 
concerning all faculty hired during the preceding year.

PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32206CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 007 
Subject: Faculty Workload 

I. Work Schedules 
A. Instructional Faculty may be assigned teaching or other professional duties on 
any day that the College is open during the academic year. The assignment of 
specific days and day/evening hours of duty during the academic year may vary 
from semester to semester. 
B. All instructional faculty who consent to a work load in excess of 32 equivalent 
semester hours per academic year or l8 equivalent semester hours per academic 
semester shall complete the Faculty Overload Form (ER-CA-3) indicating that 
they have given their consent to such an assignment. 
C. An individual schedule of work days is prepared for each academic term by the 
supervising administrator for all counselors. In addition, the supervising 
administrator shall assign or approve each such faculty member to work 40 hours 
per calendar week. Work hours may be assigned in the day and/or evening 
hours that the College is open. 
II. Responsibilities 
Faculty members are expected to perform a number of professional responsibilities as 
part of their total professional assignment. Neither reduction in work load credit nor 
additional compensation is associated with these professional responsibilities. Listed 
below, for instructional faculty and counselors are examples of the professional duties 
associated with the total assignment. 

A. Full-Time Instructional Faculty Members 
1. The primary professional responsibilities of full-time instructional faculty 
members are set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement between 
the College Board of Trustees and the College Chapter of the AAUP 
(Article V). The Agreement also addresses the expectation that 
instructional faculty are responsible for performing professional duties in 
addition to their primary teaching duties. The purpose of this section of 
the procedures is to provide guidance with respect to the “other 
professional duties” noted in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. 
2. Two additional factors are of particular relevance. First, the College has 
established Faculty Evaluation Procedures (P/P 36001CP, III.) that 
include standards of performance for all faculty members, and these 
standards provide the basis for a system of accountability applicable to 
all faculty. In addition to reference to special objectives from a preceding 
evaluation cycle, the standards focus on three broad areas: 
performance in teaching (or primary assignment), including currency in 
teaching assignment; professional growth in teaching (or primary 
assignment) and pedagogy/service techniques; and professional service 
to the campus and/or College and/or community. 
Page 1 of 8 


PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32206CP 

3. Secondly, it is important to recognize that faculty professional 
responsibilities are, by definition, broad in scope and difficult to “itemize” 
at any point in time; they are “professional” in the full sense of the word. 
Since the total assignment is affected by many factors, it is also subject 
to change in any semester or academic year. Certainly, the number of 
different course preparations being taught; the introduction of a new or 
substantially altered course; the application of new pedagogic 
techniques; the need for greater focus on professional growth or service; 
the scope of student advising; responsiveness and accountability to 
students; the necessity for course/program development or marketing; 
service on an important committee; work on a proposed new curriculum; 
and many other factors affect the expectations that a dean and other 
evaluators may have of what constitutes a total assignment for 
instructional faculty in any semester or academic year. 
4. Deans and other evaluators should discuss the total professional 
assignment with faculty members at the start of an evaluation cycle, or in 
separate meetings as the need arises. Deans also have an obligation to 
take all facets of faculty responsibilities into account in setting objectives 
and assessing performance, including the factors noted above. They 
have a further obligation to assure that all teaching faculty participate in 
the full responsibilities expected of such faculty. To do otherwise is 
simply not fair to the institution or to students, nor equitable to faculty 
members who do so. 
5. Similarly, instructional faculty have a continuing obligation to recognize 
that their professional responsibilities go beyond preparing and teaching 
a specific group of classes. Teaching and closely related activities are 
the primary responsibilities of instructional faculty, as noted in the 
Collective Bargaining Agreement and the evaluation procedures. 
However, the development of new curricula, programs, and courses; 
implementation of new pedagogic delivery techniques; service on 
department, campus, or College committees; participation in student, 
course, and program outreach activities in the College and the 
community; the development and implementation of strategies for 
student success; and professional development are just a few examples 
of professional responsibilities expected of teaching faculty, and all are 
vital to student and institutional success. 
6. As the College continues to grow and change to meet new challenges, 
these professional responsibilities will change as well. The leadership 
role of teaching faculty in the instructional program, however, will not 
change, and faculty leadership will continue to entail participation in a full 
array of professional responsibilities in the interest of our students, the 
College, and the community. 
B. Part-Time Instructional Faculty Members 
1. Conduct assigned classes in the area of employment in accordance with 
the catalog description, the course syllabi, and the stipulations of the

III. Alternate Time Assignments 
A. General 
"Alternate time" is the term used to describe the work load credit assigned by the 
College to instructional faculty members to perform tasks in lieu of teaching 
responsibilities. These assignments are in addition to, and do not replace the 
non-teaching responsibilities which are part of the total professional 
responsibilities of teaching faculty. For purposes of assigning work load credit for 
these assignments, one equivalent semester hour is equal to 50 clock hours of 
such assigned activities, except that faculty assigned to a mathematics center, 
writing center, or speech and diction center shall receive one equivalent 
semester hour for each 30 clock hours of such assigned duties. 

All alternate time assignments are made at the discretion of the campus 
VP/Provost and must be approved by the campus VP/Provost. 

B. Performing Arts Alternate Time Activities 
Page 6 of 8 


PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32206CP 

1. Faculty members may be assigned up to 3 equivalent semester hours 
alternate time per semester for performing responsibilities associated 
with the production of performing arts activities. Examples of such 
responsibilities are: director, choreographer, conductor, scenic designer, 
lighting designer, and production manager. 
2. No individual faculty member may receive more than 6 equivalent 
semester hours alternate time per semester for performing arts alternate 
time activities. 
C. Other Alternate Time Assignments 
Within budgeted allocations, the campus provost may make other alternate time 
assignments, at the rate of one equivalent semester hour work load credit for 
each 50 clock hours of assigned activities except that one equivalent semester 
hour shall be equal to 40 clock hours of such assigned activities when defined 
and budgeted by Management as Advising Cadre, Instructional Improvement, 
Curriculum Development, Program Development, Scholarly Effort, or Special 
Projects equivalent semester hours. 

D. Athletics Coaching 
1. Faculty members may be assigned up to 6 equivalent semester hours 
(ESH) alternate time per semester for performing responsibilities 
associated with athletics coaching. 
2. A faculty member may be assigned up to 6 equivalent semester hours 
(ESH) alternate time per semester for performing responsibilities 
associated with the role of campus director of athletics. 
IV. Class Coverage 
A. General 
Every scheduled class will be met, and taught, whenever possible, even at some 
inconvenience, inadequate preparation notwithstanding. Classes will be 
canceled only as a last resort and upon approval of the instructional dean.

 B. Methods of Class Coverage 
Depending on circumstances such as the amount of previous notice, the 
familiarity of the subject matter to the substitute, and the nature of the subject 
matter under assignment, there are various levels of "coverage" in order of 
preference: 

1. The class is met and taught, or the examination given, so that the 
syllabus is carried forward in spite of the absence. This should be 
especially possible in multi-section courses where different instructors 
and sections can be assumed to be fairly well together in a generally 
common syllabus. 
Page 7 of 8 


PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32206CP 

2. The class is met and continued throughout the period by discussion, 
review, in-class written assignment or similar instructional technique. 
3. The class is met, roll taken, and dismissed for further research or written 
work already assigned in the library or elsewhere. 
4. The class is met, roll taken, and dismissed. 
5. The class is canceled. 
C. Responsibilities 
1. The professional responsibility of the instructor requires that he/she 
consider substitute responsibilities as important as his/her own 
responsibility to meet with and instruct the class. 
2. Whenever a full-time or part-time instructor expects to be absent from 
class (for any reason) for a day, miss a class, or be late for a class, it is 
the instructor's responsibility to notify the instructional dean and the 
appropriate administrator. 
3. As a rule, it should not be expected that instructors should maintain a 
colleague's classes for more than a day or two; a week should be the 
limit before a paid substitute is employed. The appropriate department 
chairperson/instructional dean is responsible for ensuring that such class 
coverage is provided. 
4. The instructor may recommend a paid substitute instructor, when such a 
substitute is required. 
D. Hiring and Payment of Substitute Instructors 
1. Hiring and payment of a substitute instructor shall be approved by the 
instructional dean. 
2. Full-time faculty members shall not be hired as paid substitute 
instructors. 
3. The rate of pay for part-time faculty serving as substitute instructors shall 
be the prorated share of the course session based on the substitute’s 
academic rank and the course’s equivalent semester hours. 
Administrative Approval: September 21, 1987; September 7, 1990; August 23, 1999; May 14,

B. If a chair should leave their appointment within a term, a new chair will begin a 
new four-year appointment. 
C. An interim chair, who is later appointed through a nomination and selection 
process, will begin a new four-year appointment. The interim term period will not 
count as a formal term appointment.

department chair, their salary will be brought to the minimum of the 
grade. 
4. Once the faculty member is restored to the bargaining unit, all 
compensation and benefits will be restored to the ten-month faculty

retained and the chair will begin accruing sick leave at the rate of 
3.69 hours per pay period while in the department chair role. 
b. The balance of sick leave accrued is retained when the 
department chair returns to their full-time faculty role; and their 
full-time faculty sick leave hours will be applied at the beginning

review the proposal within the context of the approved criteria 
and make a recommendation for approval or disapproval as well 
as a recommendation as to how the applicant's responsibilities 
will be performed in his/her absence. 
d. While on extended professional development leave, the chair 
shall for all purposes, including but not limited to benefits and 
applicability of the College conflict of interest policy, be viewed 
as a full-time employee, except that annual leave and sick leave 
may not be earned or used while on professional development 
leave. 
e. A department chair granted extended professional development 
leave shall enter into a written agreement whereby the chair 
agrees to return to service at Montgomery College for a period of 
four months for each month of approved leave. 
f. If the employee fails to return and remain for the period of time 
specified in the agreement, the employee shall refund to the 
College all monies paid to him/her on his/her behalf during the 
period of the leave. 
g. The written agreement shall also provide that the employee's 
engagement in professional activities (other than those specified

program shall be submitted to the dean or ASVPAA within 30 
days of completion of the leave and shall be considered in the 
evaluation of the employee.

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32207CP 

C. The dean shares the interest of the chair to be re-appointed (or not) with the 
department faculty, staff, and appropriate unit head/administrator. 
D. If the chair is not eligible for reappointment, does not want to be re-appointed, or 
if the dean or ASVPAA (or appropriate unit head/administrator) does not wish to 
reappoint the chair, then the dean moves to the chair nomination process. 
1. If the chair is not re-appointed, notification will be provided by the fall 
semester prior to the end of the four-year term.

PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32302CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 002 
Subject: Trainee Status for Support and Associate Staff Appointments 

I. Introduction 
When it is considered by the Director of Personnel Services to be in the best interest of 
Montgomery College, a position may be filled by an applicant who does not possess all of 
the qualifications as described in the class specification. An individual so appointed will 
be identified as being in a trainee status. The trainee will hold a trainee status 
appointment until he or she has satisfactorily completed a prescribed training program 
and it has been determined by the appropriate official and the Director of Personnel 
Services that he or she meets the qualifications described in the class specification. The 
length and content of the training program shall be determined at the time of 
appointment. The training program and alterations to it must be approved by the Director 
of Personnel Services. 

II. Trainee Appointments. 
Trainee appointees have all the rights and privileges of associate and support staff 
personnel except that they shall not hold regular employee status while in trainee status. 

III. Salary Assignment of Trainees and Length of Training Program 
A. The length of the training period and the pay rate to which a trainee is assigned 
will depend on the nature of the job and the degree of training and job experience 
that the applicant possesses at the time of employment. Trainees will be 
informed of the length of the training period. 
B. Since trainees are usually subject to individually determined special pay 
conditions, during progression in their training program they will not be eligible for 
merit increments based upon the anniversary date of their initial employment 
date but will be assigned a regular merit increment date effective upon 
satisfactory completion of their training and probationary service in the new 
position. 
III. Regular Appointment. 
Upon satisfactory completion of the training program, the incumbent will serve the normal 
probationary period and upon successful completion be granted regular employee status. 

IV. Early Completion of Training Program. 
In instances of exceptionally rapid growth in competence or attainment of required 
credentials, a trainee may become eligible for removal from trainee status prior to the 
completion of the specified training program. 

Administrative Approval: September 21, 1987; September 27, 1990

PROCEDURE - Montgomery College 32303CP 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 002 
Subject: Administrative Staff Internships 

I. Establishment of Administrative Staff Internships 
From time to time the College may enter into an agreement whereby an intern, usually 
sponsored by an external organization, is assigned to work and learn at Montgomery 
College. The intern may or may not be a current employee of the College. The intern will 
be assigned to work under the supervision and guidance of one or more administrative 
staff (mentors or advisors) for any time period up to one year. The specifics of any intern 
arrangement will be detailed in a written agreement between the College and the intern 
and, where appropriate, the sponsoring external organization. 

II. Procedures for Employment of an Administrative Staff Intern 
A. At the beginning of each intern's appointment, he or she will prepare a unit plan. 
An evaluation of the intern at the end of the internship will be based on how well 
the intern has executed the objectives contained in the unit plan. The evaluation 
will be prepared by the administrator who has primary responsibility for 
supervising the intern. 
B. In recognition of the fact that an internship is primarily a professional 
development opportunity intended to provide the intern with opportunities for 
growth and development outside his or her primary skill area, and that the 
College is investing a substantial effort on behalf of the intern, the salary of the 
intern will be based on the work the intern is expected to accomplish during the 
internship, and not on the earnings received prior to the internship or expected 
after the internship. 
C. College employees on internship will be subject to the College policies and 
procedures that apply to regularly appointed administrative staff. Benefits as 
afforded by the health, life insurance and retirement programs will remain 
unchanged. At the conclusion of the internship, the intern will return to his or her 
former employee status (as faculty, administrative, associate or support staff) 
with salary placement to be at the same level as would have prevailed had the 
former employee status been continuous. 
D. Interns from outside the College will receive no vacations, holiday pay or paid 
benefits. Compensation will be on a straight per diem basis. Interns who are not 
College employees shall be considered temporary administrative staff employees 
and shall be subject to the same policies and procedures as any other temporary 
administrative staff employee. 
E. Appointment to an internship in and of itself will give no intern, whether an 
employee of Montgomery College or not, any preferred consideration for future 
positions that may be available at Montgomery College. 
Administrative Approval: September 21, 1987; September 27, 1990.

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32305CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 005 
Subject: Working Hours for Staff Employees 

I. Normal Working Hours 
A. The normal work day at the College consists of eight hours with thirty unpaid 
minutes allowed for lunch, for a work day encompassing eight hours and thirty 
minutes. The normal work week consists of five eight hour work days, unless a 
different workweek is established through a written alternative work schedule 
agreement. Unit administrators shall set the normal work day and normal work 
week for a unit and supervisors will set the schedule for each position in 
accordance with operational requirements. The Montgomery College work week 
for time reporting purposes begins at 12:00 a.m. on Saturday and ends at 11:59 
p.m. on Friday. 
B. Supervisors may grant rest periods of fifteen minutes during each half day period 
of a working day. The immediate supervisor will arrange the appropriate times 
for rest periods for employees. The total amount of time used by an employee 
for his or her lunch break and rest period(s) may not exceed one hour per day. 
Shifts in excess of 12 hours shall be provided an additional 15 minutes rest 
period, and an additional unpaid meal period may also be provided. 
Additional reasonable break time for nursing mothers will be provided for one (1) 
year 
after the child’s birth in order for the employee to express 
milk. The 
immediate supervisor will arrange a place (other than a restroom) that is shielded 
from view and free from intrusion from coworkers. 

C. Associate and support staff employees are generally employed for a specific 
work day. The College may, however, need to change the work hours of 
employees in order to meet changing requirements of the unit or College. 
Whenever such changes are required, the College will make an effort to 
implement changes with minimum inconvenience to the affected employees by, 
where operationally practical, providing at least twenty (20) work days notice of 
change in work hours intended to continue beyond ten (10) consecutive work 
days. 
D. Flextime: An individual employee may request an alteration of the normally 
scheduled workday or work week. If an employee works in excess of the number 
of normally scheduled hours on a particular day, the employee may, upon 
approval by the supervisor, reduce a workday in consideration of the time worked 
on an hour-by-hour basis within the same work week. Nothing in this section 
shall be construed to permit compensatory time (excess hours worked carried 
over as time off from one work week to another). 
E. Full-time administrators are expected to work the number of hours required to 
perform their assigned duties as management personnel, but not less than forty 
(40)hours per work week. 
II. Alternative Work Schedules 
Page 1 of 3 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32305CP 

A. Purpose 
This work alternative is intended to help the College meet its operational 
requirements; recruit and retain excellent employees; provide more flexible work 
arrangements for eligible employees; and assist in the community effort to 
reduce outdoor air pollution and traffic congestion attributable to automobile 
travel. Alternative work schedules are a privilege which may be granted in 
accordance with the parameters outlined below. Given the potential impact on 
customer service and operational needs, it is unlikely that a staff member 
approved for an alternative work schedule would also be approved for telework 
per 32500CP. Determinations will be made by the administrative unit head and 
appropriate vice president, senior vice president, or chief of staff. 

B. General 
1. All alternative work schedule requests as outlined in number 2 and 3 
below must be on the appropriate form that shall include length of time 
for which the alternative work schedule may be granted up to 12 months, 
the type of schedule requested, and the specific hours and days of work. 
In determining whether to endorse such a request, the administrative unit 
head, the appropriate vice president, senior vice president, or chief of 
staff must consider whether: 
a. Service delivery to internal and external customers will be 
maintained; 
b. Operational requirements will be met; 
c. Adequate coverage for offices or operations will be maintained 
during normal periods of public service; 
d. Satisfactory performance of the employee is evidenced by the 
most recent performance evaluation; 
e. There will be a positive impact on the environment; 
f. Increased employee engagement will be supported through 
improved work/life balance. 
g. There will be any budgetary impact of such a request. 
2. Associate and support staff may request alternative work schedules as 
follows: 
a. four ten-hour days (alternative work schedule A) 
b. four nine-hour days and one four-hour day (alternative work 
schedule B) 
3. Exempt staff may also request eight nine-hour days and one eight-hour 
day for a two-week pay period (alternative work schedule C). 
4. Once the administrators have endorsed such a request, it will be 
forwarded to the Office of Human Resources, Development, and 
Engagement for review. In the event the proposed work schedule does 
not comply with the procedure above, the Office of Human Resources, 
Development, and Engagement shall return the agreement with 
guidance regarding this procedure. Subsequent changes in schedule 
may be initiated at any time and made in accordance with I, C and II, B 
of this procedure. The Agreement will be subject to review and renewal 
no less frequently than annually, twelve months from the date the 
Page 2 of 3 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 32305CP 

arrangement began or was last renewed. Whenever there is a change in 
supervision, the unit will review and determine whether to continue all 
alternate work schedules. 

5. Administrators shall only be eligible to request alternative work 
schedules during the months of July and August, and such requests 
must be made per the guidance and process outlined above. 
Administrative Approval: September 21, 1987; November 12, 1993; February 25, 2011; March 
28, 2012; June 24, 2013.

POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 32500 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 005 
Subject: Flexible Work Arrangements 

I. Flexible work arrangements are intended to help the College meet the changing needs of 
our students and our workforce; recruit and retain excellent employees; provide more 
flexible work arrangements for eligible employees; and provide a way to conserve office 
space. 
II. It is the policy of the Board of Trustees to offer flexible work arrangements as an effective 
way to meet the needs of the College, its students, its employees, and the community. 
The Board of Trustees expects that the implementation of flexible work arrangements will 
enhance the availability and quality of College services, as well as employee productivity. 
III. Flexible work arrangements include telework, remote work, and alternative work 
schedules. Flexible work arrangements are not universally available in all occupational 
job classes and/or positions. Flexible work arrangements may be a condition of 
employment in certain job classes and positions. Flexible work arrangements must be 
authorized in advance. 

IV. Unless conditioned on employment or implemented to protect health and safety, flexible 
work arrangements are a privilege. Flexible work arrangements may be abbreviated or 
terminated in totality should office coverage become a problem due to any changes in 
work demands, office staffing, or due to other operational needs. Advanced notice will be 
given to participating employees stating the rationale for abbreviation or termination. An 
employee may discontinue participation in flexible work arrangements at any time with 
notice to a supervisor, except for those where flexible work arrangements are required of 
the position. Flexible work arrangements are not to permit employees to work at other 
jobs or to run their own businesses. Failure to fulfill normal work requirements due to 
other employment may be cause for disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 
V. The employee’s compensation, benefits, work status, and work responsibilities will not 
change due to their participation in flexible work arrangements. The amount of time the 
employee is expected to work per pay period will not change due to participation in 
flexible work arrangements. 
VI. Employees who participate in flexible work arrangements are subject to all College 
policies and procedures including, but not limited to those regarding confidentiality; 
disclosure of information; conflict of interest; and acceptable use of information 
technology resources. All participants must complete a flexible work arrangement 
application/agreement. 
VII. The Board of Trustees authorizes the president to establish any procedures necessary to 
implement this policy. 
Board Approval: March 19, 2001; May 18, 2009; June 17, 2019; October 19, 2020; April 15, 2024.

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 32500CP 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 007 
Subject: Flexible Work Arrangements 

I. Overview 
A. The following flexible work arrangements procedures apply during normal 
College operations. 
B. During an emergency closure, suspension, or mandated change in normal 
College, campus, or specific building(s) operations, specific guidance on flexible 
work arrangements will be provided, as appropriate, based on the College’s 
operational status. Subject to budget limitations, the guidance will include 
provisions for the purchase or loaning of equipment, office supplies, technology, 
assistive technology, or other items that may be necessary for employees to 
perform their job duties and ensure the continuity of operations. Any equipment 
or technology provided to employees is College property for business use only 
and must be returned when normal operations resume or upon request. 
II. Definitions 
A. Alternate (Remote) 
Work Location: A worksite approved by the employee’s 
supervisor and unit administrator that is not a College worksite. 
Alternate (remote) work locations must be in the United States. Locations within 
the U.S. are limited to the state of Maryland and states where the College has 
reciprocal payroll tax agreements. If deemed in the best interest of the College, 
exceptions may be granted with the approval of the appropriate Senior Vice 
President and Chief Human Resources Officer. 

B. Alternate Work Schedules 
1. Compressed Work Week: Regularly scheduled hours worked are fixed 
over fewer than five (5) days a week or, in some cases for exempt 
employees (only), over a two-week period. 
2. Eligible Position: An occupational job class and/or position identified by 
the Office of Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management 
(HRSTM) to be appropriate for flexible work arrangements. 
3. Flexible Work Schedule: Agreed-upon arrival and departure times that 
differ from the standard schedule for the department. The schedules may 
be fixed for a period or can vary from day to day. 
4. Flexible Work Arrangement Agreement: The documented agreement 
between the employee and the supervisor which defines and outlines the 
conditions and terms for the employee’s 
participation in the flexible work 


arrangement. 

Page 1 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 32500CP 

5. Main Work Location: An employee’s primary 
worksite and place where 
they normally perform work duties. 
6. Payroll Reciprocity: An agreement between two states that allows an 
employee that works and lives in different states to request exemption 
from tax withholding in their work state and only pay taxes in the state 
where they live. 
C. Remote Work: Remote work allows an employee to perform the duties and 
responsibilities of the 
employee’s 
position at a remote work location as their main 
(primary) work location on a routine basis. For the Remote Worker, the home or 
other approved alternate work location serves as the employee’s main 
work 
location. Remote workers may be required to periodically travel to and work from 
an onsite College work location, as needed. The types of remote work include: 
1. Voluntary Remote Work: Remote work that is authorized pursuant to the 
application and approval processes detailed below. Requests for 
voluntary remote work arrangements require the approval of the 
appropriate Senior Vice President and the Chief Human Resources 
Officer, or designee. 
2. Conditional Remote Work: Remote work that is authorized as a condition 
of employment, to protect health and safety or as the result of a certified 
accommodation. 
3. Mandated Remote Work: A period of remote work that is ordered as the 
result of an emergency situation involving health or safety pursuant to 
federal, state, local, or College mandates. 
D. Telework: Telework allows an employee to trade a commute to perform work, 
during any part of their authorized work schedule, away from their main worksite 
at an approved alternate work site. This is not a full-time arrangement. This does 
not include work done while on official travel or mobile work. The types of 
telework schedules are: 
1. Voluntary Regular Telework Schedule: Telework that occurs on a 
periodic and regularly-scheduled basis. Regular telework may also 
include situational telework schedule adjustments with supervisor 
approval. 
2. Voluntary Situational Only Telework Schedule: Telework that is approved 
on a case-by-case basis. Instances in which Situational Only Telework 
may be relevant include, but are not limited to, operational need, 
commuting issues, ability to maximize productivity and/or focus on 
special work assignments. 
3. Conditional Telework Schedule: A schedule that is authorized as a 
condition of employment, to protect health and safety, or as the result of 
a certified accommodation. 
4. Mandated Telework Schedule: A period of telework that is ordered as a 
result of a change in the College’s operational status or an emergency 


Page 2 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 32500CP 

situation involving health or safety pursuant to federal, state, local, or 
College mandates. 

E. Flexible Work Coordinator: The HRSTM staff member responsible for providing 
employees and supervisors with technical assistance and guidance; maintaining 
a list of all eligible positions; gathering and analyzing relevant data; producing 
and maintaining program records and reports; and reviewing and resolving any 
issues that may arise. The Flexible Work Coordinator does not have a role in the 
approval process. 
III. Eligibility 
A. An individual’s eligibility for flexible work arrangements is based on the 
operational and service needs of a unit, the job responsibilities and duties of a 
position, and the employees’ 
performance. Certain positions, including but not 
limited to, those responsible for providing in-person customer service or requiring 
an onsite presence may not be suited for flexible work arrangements. 
B. Given the potential impact on customer service and operational needs, it is 
unlikely that an employee approved for a voluntary regular telework schedule 
would also be approved for an alternative work schedule, but ultimately is at the 
supervisor’s discretion. 
C. Unless otherwise noted in the conditions of employment, participation in flexible 
work arrangements is at 
the supervisor’s 
discretion and will vary among 

departments, offices, and units, depending on the needs of the particular area 
and the function and responsibilities of employees. 

D. Under normal circumstances, casual temporary employees and student 
employees are not eligible for a flexible work arrangement, such as voluntary 
remote work or telework schedules, unless otherwise noted in the conditions of 
employment. 
E. Employees whose performance is documented as below “satisfactory” 
or below 
“meets expectations,” 
are currently on a performance improvement plan and/or 
have been on a performance improvement plan within 90 days prior to making 
the request are not eligible for flexible work arrangements. 
F. Employees who have received formal disciplinary action in the form of a written 
warning or suspension within the past year from the proposed start date of a 
flexible work arrangement may not be eligible to participate. 
G. In determining if it is appropriate to endorse a request for flexible work 
arrangements, the employee's supervisor must consider the 
unit’s operational 
and service delivery needs, the employee’s job 
duties 
and responsibilities, and 
the employee’s performance. Guidance for each aspect is provided on the 
Flexible Work Arrangements webpage. 

IV. Guidelines for Managing Flexible Work Arrangements 
A. It is the responsibility of the Senior Vice President and Chief of Staff/Chief 
Strategy Officer to determine the service and operational standards and flexible 
Page 3 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 32500CP 

work arrangement provisions for their respective divisions and to communicate 
these to unit administrators and supervisors in writing. 

B. Administrators should communicate the operation/service standards and flexible 
work arrangement provisions in writing to employees in their area or unit. 
C. Administrators have the discretion to manage the conditions under which flexible 
work arrangements are scheduled and operationalized within their respective 
areas if they are in accordance with the requirements of their division as 
communicated by their SVP. 
D. Flexible work arrangements may vary from person to person depending on the 
type of work and the needs of the department and the College and must be 
established and approved by the supervisor prior to beginning any flexible work 
arrangement. Non-exempt employees are not to work more than the scheduled 
hours without advance written approval from the supervisor. In the event the 
supervisor anticipates granting ad hoc flexible work arrangements outside of the 
specific schedule, the parameters of such flexibility must be outlined in advance. 
The amount of time the employee is expected to work per week and/or per pay 
period will not change due to participation in a flexible work arrangement. 
E. A voluntary regular telework schedule may include up to two (2) days per week of 
work at home or at an alternate work location. Longer telework schedules may be 
approved for a limited period on an exception basis with the approval of the 
supervisor. The daily work schedule should include appropriate breaks. 
Employees shall not perform personal business or activities during designated 
work hours. 
F. Unplanned or ad hoc requests for a flexible work arrangement during a single 
work week or pay period may be granted to an employee at the discretion of the 
employee’s supervisor. Approval of a 
one-time unplanned or ad hoc request 
does not constitute an ongoing, formal flexible work arrangement that extends 
beyond a single work week or pay period. 
G. All flexible work arrangements must conform to overtime, time tracking, paid and 
unpaid breaks, and other provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and other 
relevant employment laws. Mandatory meal breaks and/or scheduled rest 
periods are not eliminated when an employee works a flexible work arrangement. 
H. All flexible work arrangements are granted on a temporary and revocable basis 
and may be discontinued by the employee at any time or by the employee's 
supervisor with no less than ten (10) working days’ 
notice. 
I. Employees who telework/remote work must be available by telephone, email, 
video-conferencing, and/or other communication and collaboration technologies 
during scheduled work hours, with the exception of the normal 30-minute per 
work day meal period and the two 15-minute break periods permitted under 
normal College procedures. Employees are required to either forward their 
College office phone to their remote phone line or check College voicemail for 
messages at least once every two (2) hours.

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 32500CP 

J. Participants who telework/remote work are required to have the appropriate 
technology and security measures in place to perform the work as outlined in the 
flexible work arrangement agreement. In addition, telework/remote work 
employees must have access to the College e-mail system and any College 
systems and applications necessary to perform their job responsibilities. 
K. The supervisor retains the right to require an employee with a flexible work 
arrangement to be physically present at the College on a day that conflicts with 
the agreed-upon arrangement should the work situation warrant such an action. 
When possible, employees will be given reasonable notice, no less than a 
minimum of a 24-hour advance notice, of events that require their physical 
presence at the College. Notice requirements for fully remote employees may 
differ based on their remote work location and should be documented within the 
remote work agreement. An employee required to be present outside of their 
flexible work arrangement may switch their day(s) during the same work week or 
pay period with approval from their supervisor. 
L. If a telework/remote work employee is ill and unable to perform scheduled work, 
the employee will notify the supervisor and report hours worked and use of Sick 
Time Off for hours not worked. 
M. Non-exempt employees with approved flexible work arrangements are required 
to submit bi-weekly timesheets in accordance with the normal schedule. Exempt 
employees do not complete timesheets. 
N. In certain cases, taking a Family or Medical Leave of absence is a more 
appropriate option than a flexible work arrangement. For more information, 
please see College Policy and Procedure 35003-Leave Program or contact 
HRSTM. 
O. In the event of a change in the College’s operational status 
from green to either 
yellow or orange, employees should adhere to the work expectations and 
directives related to the respective status. In most instances, eligible employees 
with approved flexible work agreements with the capacity to telework will be 
required to do so if the College is not closed. Employees without approved 
flexible work agreements are not required to telework on these days. Employees 
with a flexible work schedule that coincides with a delayed opening, early 
opening, or full-day closing will be responsible for making up any hours beyond 
any granted Operational Status Change Time Off. For more information, please 
see College Policy and Procedure 58005-Closing of the College. 
V. Application, Approval, and Submission Processes 
A. Application Process 
1. Employees who desire a flexible work arrangement shall:

agreement for review and approval. 
d. Employees must submit an application at least once each fiscal 
year, or when there are any changes to the requested flexible 
work arrangement. 
B. Approval Process 
1. All flexible work arrangement applications are reviewed and approved by 
the employee’s 
direct supervisor, who will determine whether a flexible 
work arrangement is appropriate. If the direct supervisor does not 
approve the request, the direct supervisor will provide the reason for the 
decision in writing to the employee 
2. An agreed-upon flexible work arrangement will be forwarded to the next-
level supervisor in the 
employee’s supervisory chain 
for final approval. 
3. If the employee and direct supervisor are unable to agree to the terms of 
a flexible work arrangement, the employee may send a copy of the 
flexible work arrangement application, including a summary of the points 
on which the direct supervisor and employee agreed and/or disagreed, to 
the next-level supervisor in the employee’s supervisory chain. The next-
level supervisor will review the materials and approve or deny the 
request. If the request is not approved, the next-level supervisor will 
provide the reason for the decision in writing to the employee. 
4. Any employee whose flexible work arrangement is denied or terminated 
pursuant to 3 above may request that the Chief Human Resources 
Officer, or designee review the application for consistency with College 
policies and procedures, and review the denial or termination. The scope 
of the review will be limited to determining whether the action was 
arbitrary, capricious, or did not follow the existing procedure. The 
decision of the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee is final and 
binding. 
5. The approved flexible work arrangement will be subject to review and 
renewal at least annually, to correspond with the College’s fiscal year 


(July 1 to June 30). Whenever there is a change in supervision, 
employment status, office conditions, or job duties, the employee may be 
required to submit a new flexible work application. 

C. Submission Process 
1. Once the flexible work application has been reviewed and approved by 
the employee’s supervisor, the 
application should be forwarded to the 
next-level supervisor for final approval.

the Flexible Work Arrangements website for directions on how to submit 
an application online. 

3. The HRSTM Flexible Work coordinator will review and validate the 
submitted flexible work arrangement for consistency with College policies 
and procedures. 
4. Once validated, the submission constitutes the formal flexible work 
arrangement and will be maintained in the HRSTM central file. 
5. If an employee has a change to their flexible work arrangement, a new 
application must be completed, approved, and submitted to HRSTM. See 
the Flexible Work Arrangements website for directions on how to submit 
an application online. Paper copies will not be accepted. 
6. Administrators with one or more direct reports are required to prepare 
and submit a comprehensive flexible work schedule for their unit/area 
(i.e., approved schedules for employees who participate in any 
Alternative Work Schedule or telework). Unit/area Flexible Work 
Arrangement plans must be submitted three (3) times per year (i.e., fall, 
spring, summer) in accordance with the annual deadlines communicated 
by HRSTM. Employees are required to submit an application at least 
once each fiscal year, or when there are any changes to the requested 
flexible work arrangement.

An employee may request a work schedule in which the start and end times vary 
and/or differ from the standard schedule for the department. Non-exempt 
employees must work their prescribed number of hours each week. Exempt 
employees must work their prescribed number of hours within the two-week (2week) 
pay period. Flexible work schedules should be fixed for a designated 
period of time. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit compensatory 
time (excess hours worked carried over as time off from one work week to 
another).

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 32500CP 

VII. Alternate (Remote) Work Location 
A. Employees who are approved for telework and/or remote work must designate a 
specific workspace at the off-site alternate work location. This workspace will be 
considered an extension of the employee’s workspace at their main 
College work 
location. Therefore, the College will continue to be liable for job-related accidents 
of employees that occur in the alternate work location during the 
employee’s 
working hours and reserves the right to inspect the workspace upon 24 hours’ 
notice or have the employee submit a self-certified safety checklist for the 
purpose of determining that the site is safe and free from hazards. Workers’ 


Compensation liability is limited to the designated work space as opposed to all 
areas of the home and must be specifically listed on the application. 

B. The College will not be liable for theft or for damage to the employee’s real or 
personal property while the employee is working at the off-site work location. 
Also, the 
College 
assumes 
no liability for injuries occurring 
in the employee’s off-
site workspace outside of the established working hours. 
C. Employees are expected to maintain safe conditions in the off-site workspace 
and to practice the same safety habits in the designated space as in his/her 
workspace at the College. 
D. Employees remain responsible for all insurance, utility, telephone, internet 
service, and other work-related costs at the off-site location. 
E. Employees should consult their tax advisor with respect to tax consequences 
associated with telework and/or remote work. 
F. In the event of an injury at the off-site location, the employee shall immediately 
(as circumstances permit) contact his/her supervisor. 
G. Employees with approved flexible work arrangements shall adhere to all College 
policies and procedures, and guidelines on the use of information 
technology. The employee is responsible for maintaining confidentiality and 
security at the off-site workspace. 
VIII. Supplies, Equipment, and Security 
A. The College will not purchase equipment solely for the purpose of permitting an 
employee to have a flexible work arrangement, unless required by a condition of 
employment, as the result of a certified accommodation, or during periods of 
mandated remote work, subject to budget limitations. 
B. Employees may use College-owned supplies and equipment at an off-site 
workspace, with the prior, written approval of their supervisor, provided the 
supplies and equipment will be used for College work-related purposes only. 
Employees should promptly contact the IT Helpdesk and notify their supervisor of 
any malfunction in College-owned equipment. If repairs are needed, the 
employee must promptly return the equipment. 
Page 8 of 11 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 32500CP 

C. All equipment and supplies provided by the College remain the property of the 
College and if not required for onside work must be returned promptly to the 
College at the conclusion of any flexible work arrangement. 
D. When connecting to College technology resources through the College provided 
VPN, employees must use a College device issued for this purpose (i.e. College 
laptop). Employees may use their own peripheral equipment (e.g. printer, 
scanner, etc.), provided no cost is incurred by the College and that any data 
produced by this device is handled in line with College policies 66001— 
Acceptable Use of Information and 66002—Confidential Data Management and 
Security. Repair and maintenance of employee-owned equipment is the 
responsibility of the employee, as is the cost of any internet service required to 
access the College email and other information systems. 
E. Employees are required to comply with policies and procedures 66001Acceptable 
use of Information Technology, and 66002-Confidential Data 
Management and Data Security. 
IX. Supervisor/Employee Orientation, Education, and Training 
Education is a key element of this Policy. The College will provide education and 
information, as appropriate, for employees and supervisors to enhance understanding 
and increase awareness of the College’s Flexible Work Arrangements Policy and 
Procedures. The President is authorized to provide institutional leadership and guidance 
for developing education programs to increase knowledge and share information and 
resources to promote the needs of employees and students. 

Some goals to be achieved through education are; (a) ensuring that all employees and 
supervisors are aware of the availability and limitations of flexible work arrangements; (b) 
deterring the misuse or abuse of flexible work arrangements; (c) managing a virtual 
and/or geographically dispersed workforce; and (d) identifying efficiencies to be gained 
by flexible work arrangements. Any mandatory education or training requirements will be 

announced and posted 
on the College’s website. 


Employees who apply to participate in the flexible work arrangement program, and their 
supervisors, may be required to receive training for guidance regarding the use of flexible 
work arrangements. Periodic training sessions will be conducted for interested staff by 
HRSTM.

PROCEDURE – Montgomery College 33001CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 006 
Subject: Staff Classification Systems and Position Descriptions 

I. A job class is a group of positions that are sufficiently similar in type of work, level of 
difficulty and responsibility, and qualification requirements. Class specifications are the 
broad level description of a job class, a group of positions performing the same type of 
work at the same level with similar duties, responsibilities, and requirements. Position 
descriptions outline the assigned duties, responsibilities, supervisory relationships, and 
other information specific to a position. Administrative and staff positions at Montgomery 
College are classified according to the duties and responsibilities of the position and 
assigned to an occupational class. 
II. Responsibility 
The Chief Human Resources Officer is responsible for the grading of all staff 
positions. 

III. Job Classification Methodology 
The allocation of a class specification to a specific pay range shall be determined by 
market pricing methodology. Market pricing methodology is a process of examining the 
external labor market to determine the value of a position based on similar roles and 
responsibilities. 

IV. Maintenance of the Classification System 
A. Every twelve to twenty-four months or as needed, a group of benchmark jobs will 
be reviewed in accordance with the College’s established market pricing 
methodology. A benchmark job is one that is common in other similar 
organizations. 
B. This does not preclude examination of other job class specifications or individual 
position descriptions. 
V. Classification Review Request for Staff and Administrators 
Administrators and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that a position description 
accurately reflects the work performed by staff and administrators under his/her 
supervision. Position descriptions shall be reviewed and modified as appropriate at a 
minimum on an annual basis by staff and administrators and their respective supervisors 
as part of the evaluation process. 

A. The Chief Human Resources Officer may authorize the review of certain class 
specifications or certain positions under the following circumstances: major and 
significant change in the work of a job class or individual position as a result of 
reorganization, technological or regulatory change, or other unforeseen factors 
that have a significant impact on work; or prior to recruitment. A request for 
classification review must be made by the supervisor, manager, or administrator 
of the position to be reviewed. The request shall include an explanation of how 
a position has significantly changed from prior classification review. The Office of 
Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management will notify the employee, 
Page 1 of 2 


PROCEDURE – Montgomery College 33001CP 

supervisor, and administrator in writing that the request has been received. All 
requests shall be reviewed in accordance with established guidelines. 

B. The effective date of a reclassification of a position will be the first day of the first 
full pay period following the date of the decision by the Chief Human Resources 
Officer. 
VI. Position Descriptions of Administrators 
The development of position descriptions for proposed new administrative staff positions 
or modification of existing positions is the responsibility of the administrator’s supervisor. 
Modifications involving changes to organizational structure or the basic function of the 
position, should be reviewed only after discussion with and with the agreement of the 
President or designee.

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 005 
Subject: Probationary and Regular Status for Staff Employees 

Probationary Period 

Probationary period is that period of time that an employee is required to serve in a 
position to demonstrate his or her knowledge, skills and ability to perform the duties of 
said position satisfactorily. Probationary periods are required for all new hires, and for 
regular staff who are promoted or transferred into a different job class, and for temporary 
employees who are promoted or transferred into a regular position. 

II. Conditions of Probationary Status for Staff Employees 
A. The normal probationary period for staff employees shall be six months, with the 
following exceptions:

2. A temporary, acting, or interim employee filling a regular position and 
subsequently appointed to that position on a regular basis without a 
break in service shall be entitled to be credited with an amount of service 
credit toward regular status. The credited service shall be equal to the 
time served between appointment as a temporary employee and 
appointment as a regular employee. 
3. If there are sufficient similarities between positions, each 
probationary-status employee who is transferred from one regular 
position to another regular position of like responsibility may, upon 
approval by the Chief Human Resources Officer, retain the period 
satisfactorily served in the former position for credit towards earning 
regular status as a regular employee. However, depending on the 
specific situation, or if the prior service has not been satisfactory, the 
employee may be assigned a new probationary period. 
B. The Chief Human Resources Officer may, however, assign longer probationary 
periods when deemed appropriate and necessary to the situation. 
C. A regular-status employee transferring to a temporary position shall automatically 
forfeit regular status as an employee. 
D. The incumbent of a reclassified position shall retain the status--probationary or 
regular--held in that position at the time it is reclassified.

E. A supervisor may recommend extension of that employee’s probationary period 
for a specified period of time, not to exceed six additional months. 
F. The Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, will review the 
recommendation. If the extension is approved, the Chief Human Resources 
Officer, or designee, will notify the employee in writing at least two weeks in 
advance of the effective date of the extension of the probationary period and 
three weeks prior to the date the employee is eligible for regular status. 
G. In the event the Chief Human Resources Officer, or designee, does not approve

1. General: Except as stated below, Administrators waive any right to 
tenure in any position at the College and are not deemed to be granted 
continuing tenure or similar status. 
2. Exception: If a person who qualified for and was granted academic 
tenure as a member of the faculty of Montgomery College is appointed to 
an administrative staff position, that person shall continue to retain 
tenure as a faculty member only. That person shall not be deemed to 
have been granted continuing tenure or similar status in an 
administrative position. If that person is subsequently reassigned to a 
faculty position, he/she will continue to retain the faculty tenure that was 
previously granted. 
II. Changes in Administrator Status 
A. Reassignment 
1. The President may reassign an Administrator at any time to a position for 
which the person is qualified. Any reassignment shall be in the sole 
discretion of the President. In the event of reassignment, the terms and 
conditions of employment governing the position to which the 
administrator has been reassigned, including but not limited to salary pay 
range, shall apply. 
2. The reassignment shall not result in a salary reduction during the fiscal 
year in which the reassignment occurs unless the reassignment is based 
on lack of funding or economic or financial difficulties. 
B. Abolishment of Administrator Positions 
1. Lack of Funding and/or Economic or Financial Difficulties 
a. The President may abolish an Administrator position at any time 
Page 1 of 8 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34001CP 

based on lack of funding and/or economic difficulties. The 
employment of an Administrator may be terminated at any time 
based on economic difficulties, including but not limited to lack of 
funding. Such abolishment and/or termination shall be in the sole 
discretion of the President. 

b. In the event that the President deems it necessary to abolish an 
Administrator position and/or terminate the employment of an 
Administrator based on lack of funding or economic difficulties, 
the President will notify the affected employee in writing that the 
position is being abolished and/or that the Administrator’s 
employment is being terminated, state the effective date of the 
action(s) and the reason for such termination. In the event of 
termination under this provision, an Administrator will be given at 
least a minimum of 60-days notice. 
c. If economic or financial difficulties result in termination of an 
Administrator, the affected employee will be given consideration 
for other vacant positions for which the Administrator may be 
qualified. 
2. Reorganization 
a. If the functions of an Administrator position change substantially 
or if there is no longer a need for an Administrator position as a 
result of changes in the organization or operation of the College, 
an Administrator position may be reclassified or abolished by the 
President. Such abolishment or reclassification shall be in the 
sole discretion of the President. 
b. If the reorganization results in abolishment of an Administrator 
position, the incumbent of any such position will be notified in 
writing that the Administrator position is being abolished and the 
effective date of the action. The affected Administrator will be 
given appropriate consideration for other vacant positions for 
which he/she may be qualified. In such circumstances, the 
affected administrative staff employee shall be given at least 
sixty (60) calendar days notice of the effective date of the 
abolishment. 
c. If the reorganization results in reclassification of an Administrator 
position, the following procedures will apply. 
(1) The incumbent of any such position will be notified in 
writing that the Administrator position is being 
reclassified and the effective date of the action. 
(2) If the incumbent is qualified for the reclassified position, 
the incumbent may be reassigned to that position. 
(3) If the incumbent is not being reassigned, he/she will be 
given appropriate consideration for other vacant 
positions for which the Administrator may be qualified. If 
Page 2 of 8 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34001CP 

the reclassification results in termination of employment 
notice will be given at least sixty (60) calendar days 
before the effective date of such termination. 

III. Administrative Associate Assignments 
A. General 
1. Administrative Associate assignments provide professional development 
opportunities for full-time faculty, part-time faculty, and regular staff, 
depending on the availability of appropriate funding sources. These 
assignments allow full-time faculty and staff members to temporarily 
perform specific administrative projects that make use of special 
employee skills and talents on an alternate time basis. 
2. Administrative Associate assignments may be full-time or part-time. 
B. Requests 
1. Each College administrative office may request the assistance of an 
Administrative Associate, within the parameters of the College planning 
and budgeting process, by submitting a memorandum through 
appropriate channels. The memorandum will outline the following: 
a. Description and objectives of the project; 
b. Justification for using faculty/staff expertise and skills required; 
c. The position number and supervisor for the position; 
d. The coverage plan for the individual if that individual is leaving 
an existing position at the College to serve as the Administrative 
Associate; and 
e. Estimated time support required. 
2. The office making the request will include the project within its unit plan. 
C. Applications 
Each employee interested in an advertised administrative associate assignment 
will submit in writing to the appropriate administrator a request to be considered 
for the assignment. The request will include: 

1. Qualifications for the specific assignment. 
2. Specific reasons for desiring the administrative associate assignment. 
3. Approval of current supervisor. 
D. Selection 
The responsible administrator will interview all qualified applicants. The 
administrator shall select an associate keeping in mind the objectives to be 
accomplished; qualifications of the applicants; and specialized past experience 
that may be of benefit in meeting the specific objectives within a time limit 
important to a particular assignment. It is also important to recognize that the 

Page 3 of 8 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34001CP 

selection of qualified employees from underrepresented groups may assist the 
College in meeting its affirmative action goals. The selection of employees for 
administrative associate assignments must be made well in advance of an 
academic semester to allow for selection of qualified replacements. 

E. Evaluation 
At the beginning of each assignment the administrator and the associate will 
establish specific goals and objectives. Within one month after termination of the 
assignment, the associate will submit a self-evaluation and an evaluation of the 
assignment to the responsible administrator with a copy to the appropriate Senior 
Vice President. A performance evaluation of the employee will be forwarded by 
the responsible administrator to the appropriate provost/supervisor upon request. 

IV. Changes in Staff Employee Status 
A. Employee Transfers and Reassignment 
The College values professional development, and encourages staff and faculty 
to identify and pursue other positions within the College that will add to their 
potential growth. Moreover, as the needs of the College evolve, the College may 
need to reallocate or reassign staff to other positions, departments or locations to 
address those changing needs. Reassignment to a different campus or location 
is not considered a change in status and is not appealable. The College’s ability 
to quickly respond to our students’ rapidly changing needs is crucial to our 
students’ success. The College is committed to a level of agility that is 
responsive to our students, and College employees understand that duties and 
locations of their jobs may change according to these needs. 

1. Staff Transfer 
a. Employees who have successfully completed a probationary 
period, if applicable, may apply to any vacant position. Any such 
vacant position will need to have appropriate funding prior to 
finalizing any transfer. 
b. An employee or supervisor may identify an opportunity for a 
lateral move, where an employee transfers from one position to 
another in the same compensation grade. This type of lateral 
transfer may be made if the current and receiving supervisors 
and the employee agree, the employee meets the requirements 
of the position, and the transfer is approved the chief human 
resource officer or designee. In cases where transfers are 
approved for a position with an ongoing recruitment effort, the 
hiring supervisor will notify the relevant human resources staff. 
2. Staff Reassignment 
a. Upon recommendation of the employee’s supervisor and in 
consultation with the receiving supervisor and the Office of 
Human Resources, the College may transfer an employee 
between similar positions without the employee’s consent when 
Page 4 of 8 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34001CP 

such transfer is deemed to be in the best interest of the College. 

b. Notification of a reassignment shall be made in writing by the 
employee/labor relations administrator, or designee, to the 
affected employee at least two weeks prior to the effective date 
of transfer. The notification shall contain (i) the reasons for the 
transfer, (ii) whether there will be any material change in the 
employee's status, including but not limited to a change in shift, 
wages, location, etc., and (iii) any appeal rights. 
c. An employee having been notified of a pending reassignment 
may appeal such reassignment to the chief human resources 
officer within five (5) working days of receipt of such notification. 
The appeal should state the reason(s) why such reassignment 
would not be in the best interest of the College. The chief human 
resources officer, or designee, may uphold, modify, or rescind 
the reassignment. The decision of the chief human resources 
officer, or designee, shall be final. 
d. An employee who remains in the same position but is reassigned 
to a different campus or location is not considered to have a 
change in status, and thus the reassignment is not appealable. 
e. Temporary Reassignments. An employee may be temporarily 
reassigned to another position, if qualified, or another College 
location, on a temporary basis, in the best interest of the College. 
Such a reassignment must last fewer than six months, and shall 
be subject to an additional one-time renewal of no more than five 
months. Temporary reassignments shall be approved by the 
chief human resource officer or designee. An employee shall 
receive written notice at least two weeks in advance of the 
effective date of the temporary reassignment. Temporary 
reassignments are not appealable. 
3. Retention of Service Credit. An employee in good standing who is 
transferred pursuant to this procedure shall retain the service time from 
the employee’s former position for credit toward the award of an annual 
salary adjustment. 
4. Rights of Transferred Employee. If a staff employee fails to perform 
satisfactorily the duties and responsibilities of the position to which he or 
she was transferred (except for reasons that warrant disciplinary action), 
an effort will be made to place the employee in a comparable vacant 
position if possible pursuant to College Policy and Procedure 34003Probationary 
and Regular Status for Staff Employees. 
5. A temporary assignment or reassignment of duties does not constitute a 
transfer of any kind and is not appealable. 
B. Promotion of Staff Employees 
1. Promotion of staff employees is defined as: 
Page 5 of 8 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34001CP 

a. an appointment to a position that has a higher grade; or 
b. the assignment of higher level duties and responsibilities. 
The reallocation of an existing job class to a higher grade is not 
considered a promotion. See 35001/35001CP Compensation Programs. 

2. Conditions for Promotion 
a. All promotions should be made in consultation with human 
resources staff and/or the appropriate administrator(s) for the 
unit. 
b. Promotions in the College may occur in a variety of ways, 
including but not limited to: 
1) Promotional vacancies 
2) Internal searches 
3) External searches 
4) Managerial discretion 
5) Completion of advanced degrees 
6) Substantial service and contribution to the College 
c. The above list of factors may give rise to the opportunity for a 
promotion, but do not guarantee such promotion will be available 
or offered. Other factors, such as budgetary constraints, must 
also be considered in offering a promotion. 
d. Every effort shall be made to ensure that an adequate pool of 
individuals is identified and considered for promotion at any 
level. 
e. Before a promotion may take effect, the job description for the 
position must be reviewed and approved by appropriate staff in 
the Office of Human Resources, and the promoted employee 
must qualify for the position. 
C. Demotion of Staff Employees 
1. Demotion is the movement of an employee from one position to another 
position at a lower grade, and may be voluntary or involuntary. 
Demotions resulting from disciplinary action are addressed in 34002CPDisciplinary 
Action and Suspension. Reductions in grade as a result of 
the maintenance of the classification system are not demotions. 
2. Voluntary Demotion – A voluntary demotion to a lower level position will 
be accompanied by a commensurate salary reduction. However, no 
employee may receive a salary that is above the maximum for the 
employee’s new grade unless special circumstances clearly indicate 
such reduction is not in the College’s best interest. The decision in this 
matter shall be made by the chief human resources officer, or designee. 
The chief human resources officer shall notify the employee in writing of 
the effects of the demotion on the employee’s status. 
Page 6 of 8 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34001CP 

3. Demotion Due to Elimination of Position – A demotion due to the 
elimination of a position is an involuntary demotion that is nondisciplinary. 
The College may involuntarily demote an employee to a 
vacant position if the College has decided to eliminate the employee’s 
incumbent position. The salary of an employee, who is demoted due to a 
position elimination may be reduced when the employee is assigned to a 
lower grade should his or her salary be above the maximum of the pay 
grade for the new position. 
3. Appeals from Demotion 
a. Except as stated in subparagraph (c) below, a 
probationary-status employee cannot appeal a demotion. 
b. A regular status employee who has been demoted may appeal 
such demotion to the chief human resources officer within five 
(5) working days of the receipt of the notification of the action. 
c. A staff employee who is in a probationary-status due to a 
promotion shall have the same appeal rights outlined in 
subparagraph (b) above. 
V. Reduction-In-Force for Non-Bargaining Staff Employees 
A. A reduction-in-force (RIF) occurs when the College decides, as part of a single 
decision-making process, to eliminate at least two positions and terminate, 
demote, transfer, promote, or reassign the employment of the incumbents in 
those positions, because of financial exigency, decline in student enrollment, 
program change(s), or other reasons which will necessitate a reduction in staff. 
B. The chief human resources officer, after consultation with appropriate 
administrators, shall recommend a reduction-in-force and indicate the reasons 
therefore to the President, or designee. The recommendation should include the 
names and job titles of those employees whose positions are recommended for 
elimination. 
C. The President, or designee, may approve or disapprove the recommendation. If 
the President, or designee, approves the recommendation, the chief human 
resources officer, or designee, shall notify the appropriate administrators and 
supervisors of the recommendation. 
Before recommending layoffs, the chief human resources officer will consider 
whether the transfer of employees to other positions is in the best interest of the 
College. If the chief human resources officer determines layoffs are necessary 
and the President approves, seniority shall be among the determining factors 
between employees deemed to be of the same relative competence. To 
determine whether employees are of the same relative competence, 
performance evaluations will be consulted. If evaluations are not available for all 
employees in the job title and affected group, the supervisor must complete the 
evaluation as soon as is practicable. Length of service shall be among the factors 
between employees of the same relative competence. In no event shall an 
employee with regular status be terminated and an employee with temporary or 

Page 7 of 8 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34001CP 

probationary status be retained in the same job title. 

D. The chief human resources officer shall notify the employee(s) in writing of the 
reasons for the reduction-in-force and whether there are opportunities for 
reemployment or continued employment, and appeal procedures. Each 
employee shall be given at least ninety (90) calendar days, or the applicable 
period required by law, between notification and implementation of the RIF. 
Human resources representatives shall also meet with the affected employees to 
discuss the recommendation and options for continued employment (e.g., 
transfer, demotion, or promotion) and reemployment. 
E. Appeals 
1. Determinations made in the course of a reduction-in-force proceeding 
are not subject to the grievance procedure. Employment decisions made 
as part of a RIF, as described in this procedure, are not generally 
appealable. However, an employee whose employment status changes 
due to a reduction-in-force is permitted to submit an appeal solely 
regarding the RIF procedures set forth above. The appeal must show a 
clear and significant deviation from the procedures that likely would have 
resulted in a different outcome. 
2. The appeal must be made in writing to the chief human resources officer, 
or designee, within five (5) working days after receiving the written 
notification of change in employment status. The appeal must state the 
clear and significant deviation(s) from this procedure, and how the 
different outcome(s) were likely had the procedure been followed. 
3. The chief human resources officer, or designee, shall within ten (10) 
working days review the procedure followed in the RIF that is subject to 
the appeal. The chief human resources officer, or designee, shall provide 
the appealing employee a written response containing the findings. 
4. If the appeal is resolved in favor of the employee, the chief human 
resources officer, or designee, shall fashion an appropriate remedy. If 
the appeal is resolved against the employee, the change in employment 
status shall be effective no less than two weeks from the date of written 
notification of final appeal decision. 
Presidential Approval: September 21, 1987; May 23, 1988; November 6, 1989; July 16, 1993; 
October 18, 1993; March 2, 2004 (editorial); January 10, 2012; December 20, 2012; June 10, 
2013; June 28, 2018.

POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 34002 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 001 
Subject: Disciplinary Action and Suspension 

I. It is the policy of the Board of Trustees to encourage high standards of service, fair, 
equitable and consistent handling of unacceptable employee behavior or acts, and 
constructive counseling. Employees whose behavior, actions or inactions are 
unacceptable shall be subject to disciplinary action. Disciplinary action shall generally be 
progressive in nature, and include but not be limited to a warning, reprimand, suspension, 
or dismissal. Except for unusually serious offenses, dismissal will not be proposed 
unless there is a previous record of disciplinary action against the employee. 
II. Nothing in this or any other policy shall preclude disciplinary action against an employee 
regardless of whether the employee may have a satisfactory performance rating or 
regardless of the lack of previous disciplinary actions against the employee. 
III. The President is authorized to establish procedures to implement this policy. 
Board Approval: September 21, 1987.

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34002CP 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 007 
Subject: Disciplinary Action and Suspension 

I. General 
A. The general purpose of disciplinary action is to correct improper performance or 
behavior, to provide clear notification when improvement is needed, and to hold 
employees accountable for their impact on the workplace. Employees whose 
behavior, actions or inactions are unacceptable are subject to disciplinary action. 
B. The degree of discipline shall depend on the gravity of the offense and the 
circumstances under which it occurred. Disciplinary action taken by supervisors 
should be timely and progressive including, but not limited to, a warning, 
reprimand, suspension, demotion, or dismissal. However, at times, factors may 
make it impracticable in individual cases to give prior warnings; e.g., when 
behavior or acts are of so grave a nature that a first occasion violation is a cause 
for a recommendation for the employee's discharge. 
C. Nothing in this or any other policy or procedure of this manual shall preclude 
taking adverse action against an employee, if such action is appropriate, 
regardless of whether the employee may have a current official performance 
rating of satisfactory or better, or regardless of the lack of previous disciplinary 
actions. 
D. Non-bargaining staff employees may be accompanied by another non-bargaining 
staff employee to provide support during the disciplinary process outlined below. 
The support person may be selected by the employee (subject to certain 
limitations; i.e., the staff of the General Counsel’s Office or the Office of 
Employee and Labor Relations may not serve as a support person), and the 
support person may not participate in the process, but may take notes. 
E. As used in this procedure, working days are defined as all days during the 
calendar year where the College is open for the normal course of business other 
than Saturdays, Sundays, and days the College is closed. 
II. Reasons for Disciplinary Action 
Any one of the following shall be deemed sufficient reason to discipline an employee, 
although discipline may be for reasons other than those listed below. 

A. Insubordination. 
B. Misconduct or malfeasance or nonfeasance of duty. 
C. Dishonesty in the performance of duties or in activities related to the performance 
of duties. 
D. Unsatisfactory attendance or tardiness record. 
E. Performance issues, such as, but not limited to, failing to discharge duties in a 
Page 1 of 7 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34002CP 

satisfactory or timely manner. 

F. Unauthorized access of confidential information, including but not limited to 
student or personnel records; as well as misuse of confidential information for 
purposes other than the legitimate discharge of duties. 
G. Unauthorized possession, use, sale, or distribution of alcoholic beverages or of 
any illegal or controlled substance while at work or on College premises or off 
College premises while in duty status. 
H. Unauthorized use, possession, or storage of any weapon, dangerous chemical, 
or explosive element. 
I. Disorderly conduct on the job. 
J. Violation of safety regulations and instructions. 
K. Unauthorized use of, or negligent damage to, College property. 
L. Littering, defacing, damaging or destroying College property or property under its 
jurisdiction, or removing, using, occupying or entering such property without 
authorization. 
M. Theft or attempted theft of College property or services, or personal property, or 
knowingly possessing such stolen property. 
N. Loafing, intentional idleness or sleeping while in duty status. 
O. Misappropriation of public funds. 
P. Misrepresentation, falsification, or intentional omission of a material fact(s) in 
connection with employment application, or any record, report, investigation or 
other proceeding involving a work related matter. 
Q. Forging, altering, falsifying or misusing College documents, records or 
identification cards. 
R. Unauthorized or fraudulent use of the College's facilities and/or equipment 
including but not limited to the phone system, mail system, computer system, 
transportation system and/or equipment, or use of any of the above for any illegal 
act. 
S. Causing false information to be presented before any administrative proceeding 
of the College when a person knew or reasonably should have known that the 
information was false or intentionally destroying evidence important to such a 
proceeding. 
T. Initiation of, or causing to be initiated, any false report, warning or threat of fire, 
explosion or other emergency. 
U. Physical or mental abuse, threat or harassment of a College student, employee 
or any other person on College premises or any other conduct which threatens or 
Page 2 of 7 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34002CP 

endangers the health or safety of any such person. 

V. Violation of law which is directly related to on the job performance. 
W. Violation of a College policy and/or procedure. 
X. Encouraging others to commit any of the above acts. 
The above list is not exhaustive and the College may sanction other conduct deemed 
harmful to the best interests of the College, its students, or its employees, or conduct that 
adversely affects the rendering of prompt, courteous, or efficient service by the College. 
Attempts to commit acts stated above or encouraging or assisting others to commit such 
acts may be punished to the same extent as if one had committed the act itself. 

In addition, the College reserves the right to pursue any and all remedies available at law 
or equity. 

III. Procedures for Certain Disciplinary Actions 
A. Disciplinary actions should generally be corrective in nature. The most common 
disciplinary actions are outlined below, but the College may, in its sole discretion, 
choose other remedial measures. 
B. Bargaining unit staff and administrators have provisions detailing certain 
disciplinary processes in their contracts. To the extent that disciplinary action is 
taken with respect to those administrators and bargaining staff, the relevant 
contractual provision shall control the procedure. 
C. Oral or Verbal Reprimands 
1. A private discussion shall be held between the supervisor and the 
employee to discuss the employee's problem and to afford the employee 
an early opportunity to correct the problem. 
2. Oral or verbal reprimands shall be noted in writing by the supervisor for 
possible later reference and be sent to HRSTM to be included in the 
employee's personnel file. Outcomes of a verbal reprimand may be 
documented but does not rise to the level of a written reprimand. 
D. Written Reprimands 
1. Supervisors within the employee's supervisory chain may issue written 
reprimands, which must indicate the nature of the problem, refer to any 
previous oral or written reprimands, indicate what the employee must do 
to correct the problem and indicate that further disciplinary action will be 
taken for subsequent offenses. 
2. The supervisor shall discuss the written reprimand with the employee. 
Written reprimands may be formally recognized and noted in a 
performance evaluation as influencing a salary increment, promotion 
recommendation or performance rating. 
Page 3 of 7 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34002CP 

3. Written reprimands shall be timely issued, typically within ten (10) 
working days of the incident, with a copy sent to HRSTM to be included 
in the employee’s personnel file. 
IV. Disciplinary Demotion of Staff 
A. The Director of Employee and Labor Relations has the authority to demote 
employees as a disciplinary remedy. Such decisions are subject to the review 
of the Senior Vice President of Administrative and Fiscal Services at the 
request of the affected employee. A demotion may include, but may not be 
limited to, a reduction in pay, a reduction in duties or responsibilities, and/or a 
reduction in title or rank. 
B. The unit supervisor, after appropriate consultation with HRSTM, shall submit in 
writing the recommendation for demotion to the Director of Employee & Labor 
Relations. The recommendation must be accompanied by sufficient 
documentation to justify the demotion. Sufficient documentation should include 
a description of the problem, and reference to any prior oral or written warnings 
or reprimands. The supervisor shall indicate the corrective action necessary and 
also indicate if subsequent similar behavior may result in a recommendation for 
the employee's dismissal. 
C. The Director of Employee & Labor Relations shall give the affected employee 
notice of the proposed demotion, the justification for the demotion, an opportunity 
to respond to the proposed demotion and to present rebuttal evidence. 
D. An employee demoted for disciplinary reasons shall also have their salary 
reduced by an amount proportionate to the reduction in the new position duties. 
However, no employee may receive a salary higher than the maximum of the 
salary range for the demoted position classification. 
E. A staff employee who has been demoted may grieve such demotion in 
accordance with 34101CP-Personnel Grievance Process For Non-Bargaining 
Staff Employees at the Formal Grievance Step. 
V. Disciplinary Suspension 
The College may suspend an employee whose behavior, action(s) or inaction(s) warrant 
discipline more severe than a written warning but less severe than termination. The 
duration of the suspension shall depend on the severity of the offense(s). 

A. The supervisor shall consult with their supervisor as well as the staff of the Office 
of Employee & Labor Relations prior to recommending a suspension. 
B. The supervisor shall submit a recommendation for suspension in writing to the 
College’s designated authority (the President for administrators, the Vice 
President & Provost for instructional faculty, the Senior Vice President for 
Student Affairs for counseling faculty, and the Director of Employee & Labor 
Relations for Staff). 
C. The designated authority will review the recommendation. The designated 
Page 4 of 7 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34002CP 

authority may request additional information from either party. 

D. The designated authority shall give the employee an opportunity to respond and 
present rebuttal evidence. 
E. Typically within three working days (3), the designated authority shall respond to 
the parties in writing, stating whether the recommendation is adopted, rejected, 
or modified, and the reasons for that conclusion. 
F. Suspended employees may grieve the decision via Procedure 34101, beginning 
at the Formal Grievance Step. 
VI. Investigatory Suspension 
A. An employee who is alleged to have committed an offense which would warrant 
disciplinary action may be suspended and placed on investigatory leave at any 
time for purposes of investigation. The Director of Employee and Labor Relations 
shall determine the appropriate duration of such administrative leave and 
whether such leave shall be paid or unpaid. All investigations are conducted with 
the highest level of confidentiality permitted by the facts and circumstances to 
remedy the issue. 
B. Staff and Faculty 
1. The Director of Employee & Labor Relations may suspend an employee 
with or without pay for purposes of investigation at any time. Such 
suspension notice shall be in writing to the employee and shall contain a 
statement of the reasons(s) for the suspension and the effective date of 
suspension. If the employee is a member of a bargaining unit, the 
Director of Employee & Labor Relations will notify the relevant union 
representative and proceed in accordance with any applicable procedure 
in the appropriate collective bargaining agreement, to the extent such 
procedure departs from this procedure. 
2. If the suspension is without pay, the Director of Employee & Labor 
Relations shall provide the affected employee with an opportunity to 
explain the employee's position on the matter. 
3. Upon completion of such investigation, after consultation with the 
supervisor of the suspended employee, the Director of Employee & 
Labor Relations shall determine what action should be taken and shall so 
notify the employee and the supervisor in writing. If the results of the 
investigation do not substantiate the allegations, the employee will be 
reinstated and remunerated for lost wages and benefits. If the results of 
the investigation indicate that a disciplinary suspension is appropriate, 
the time the employee has been suspended without pay, if any, shall be 
deducted from the disciplinary suspension period. If the results of the 
investigation indicate that termination is appropriate, the Director of 
Employee & Labor Relations shall take the appropriate action. 
3. A staff employee who has been suspended may grieve such suspension 
in accordance with 34101CP-Personnel Grievance Process for Non-
Page 5 of 7 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34002CP 

Bargaining Staff Employees at the Formal Grievance Step. 

4. The Director of Employee and Labor Relations may keep the employee's 
supervisory chain apprised of the status of an investigatory suspension. 
C. Administrators 
1. The President may immediately suspend with or without pay an 
administrator for investigation at any time. 
2. The administrator shall receive a written notification of the suspension 
which contains a statement of the reasons(s) for the suspension and the 
effective date of suspension. 
3. If the suspension is without pay, the affected administrator shall have an 
opportunity to explain his/her position on the matter prior to 
implementation of the suspension. 
3. Upon completion of such investigation, after consultation with the 
supervisor of the suspended administrator, the Director of Employee & 
Labor Relations shall determine what action should be taken and shall so 
notify the administrator and the supervisor in writing. If the results of the 
investigation do not substantiate the allegations, the administrator will be 
reinstated and remunerated for lost wages and benefits. If the results of 
the investigation indicate that a disciplinary suspension is appropriate, 
the time the administrator has been suspended without pay, if any, shall 
be deducted from the disciplinary suspension period. If the results of the 
investigation indicate that termination is appropriate, the Director of 
Employee & Labor Relations shall take the appropriate action. 
VI. Administrator Pre-separation Suspension: The President may immediately suspend with 
or without pay an administrator to whom the President has given notification of intended 
termination of employment or non-renewal of an employment agreement when the 
President, in his/her sole discretion, believes that such action is in the best interest of the 
College. The length of the suspension shall be in the sole discretion of the President. 
VII. Education 
Education is a key element of this Policy. The College will provide education and 
information, as appropriate, for employees to enhance understanding and increase 
awareness of the College’s Disciplinary Action and Suspension Policy and Procedures. 
Sufficient periodic training will be conducted for supervisors and for those with direct 
reports. Any mandatory education requirements will be announced and posted on the 
College’s website. The President is authorized to provide institutional leadership and 
guidance for developing education programs to increase knowledge and share 
information and resources to prevent violations, promote safety, and reduce perpetration. 
Some goals to be achieved through education are: (a) ensuring that all individuals are 
aware of their rights; (b) notifying individuals of conduct that is proscribed; (c) informing 
potential employees, employees, supervisors, and other members of the college 
community about the proper way to recognize and address violations of this Policy; and 

(d)preventing issues that this Policy addresses.

POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 34003 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 002 
Subject: Discharge of Administrators and Staff 

I. It is the policy of the Board of Trustees to encourage high standards of service, and fair, 
equitable and consistent treatment of employees, recognizing that circumstances may 
arise which preclude continuing employment and result in the termination of an 
employee. 
II. Any employee whose behavior, act(s) or performance is unacceptable shall be subject to 
dismissal for cause. Administrative staff employees who are recommended to be 
dismissed for cause during the one year contractual period of employment and regular 
associate and support staff employees who are recommended to be dismissed for cause 
shall have the right to appeal that recommendation. 
III. Temporary associate and support staff employees, probationary new regular employees 
and temporary casual employees are not granted the right to appeal. 
IV. The President is authorized to establish procedures to implement this policy. 
Board Approval: September 21, 1987; April 8, 2019.

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34003CP 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 005 
Subject: Discharge of Administrators and Staff 

I. Discharge for Cause 
A. The Procedure herein applies to all staff, except when an individual employment 
contract or collective bargaining agreement calls for other procedures. Certain 
employees under contract with the College – i.e., administrators and employees 
who are members of a certified collective bargaining unit with the College – may 
be subject to contractual provisions for dismissal. In cases where a contractual 
agreement includes provisions for dismissal that do not match the procedure 
contained herein, the applicable contract shall control the process. In all other 
cases, including when a contract is silent on the issue, the Procedure herein shall 
apply. 
B. An employee may be discharged for cause. For purposes of these procedures 
cause includes, but is not limited, to: 
1. incompetent, inefficient, negligent or unsatisfactory performance of 
duties; 
2. any unacceptable behavior, action or inaction which would be a cause to 
discipline an employee (see 34002-Disciplinary Action and Suspension); 
3. violations of other Policies or Procedures; or conviction of a crime which 
renders the employee unsuitable for continued employment at the 
College. 
C. Discharge generally occurs as the final step in progressive discipline, but serious 
offenses may result in discharge prior to exhausting all steps in the disciplinary 
process. 
D. Employee Rights 
1. Sufficient notice of discharge, as outlined herein; and 
2. The opportunity to be heard and to present relevant evidence. 
II. Procedure for Discharge 
A. A supervisor in an employee’s direct supervisory chain may recommend 
discharge of an employee. 
B. A supervisor may only recommend discharge after consulting with both the 
Director of Employee & Labor Relations or designee and the Administrator in 
charge of the unit. The Director of Employee & Labor Relations will determine 
whether an Investigatory Suspension pursuant to Procedure 34002CP is 
appropriate while the recommendation for discharge is under review. If the 
Director of Employee & Labor Relations does not support the proposed 
recommendation, then he or she will recommend alternative remedies, such as 
engaging the Ombuds, engaging a mediator, or providing training as appropriate. 
C. The recommending supervisor shall provide the employee with written notice of 
Page 1 of 4 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34003CP 

the recommendation for discharge, with a copy to the Director of Employee & 
Labor Relations, which must include: 

1. The reason(s) for the recommendation; 
2. Any prior disciplinary or remedial actions; 
3. If applicable, any evidence of wrongdoing, failure to abide by Policy or 
Procedure, or failure to discharge duties; and 
4. The effective date of the discharge. 
5. Notice of the employee’s status pending the outcome of the 
recommendation and/or any appeal. 
D. The employee may rebut the recommendation verbally or in writing or both within 
ten (10) working days of receiving notice of proposed discharge to the Director of 
Employee & Labor Relations. Employee and Labor Relations will assist 
employees without access to College systems to gather necessary 
documentation to respond to any recommendations. Failure to meet the 
deadline, without showing just cause, will result in the employee forfeiting his/her 
right to rebut the proposed discharge and/or request an appeal hearing. 
E. The Director of Employee and Labor Relations (or designee) shall evaluate the 
proposed discharge, which shall include, but not necessarily be limited to: 
1. The employee’s disciplinary record; 
2. The reasons the supervisor stated for discharge; 
3. The employee’s rebuttal, if any; and 
4. The supporting documentation from both parties. 
F. If the Director of Employee and Labor Relations finds, after a review of the items 
enumerated in Section II, E above, that the evidence supports the 
recommendation for discharge, the Director may adopt the recommendation. The 
employee may then request a hearing (as outlined in Section III below). 
G. For dismissal resulting from certain disciplinary actions, the recommendation 
may be made by an administrator (or designee) with oversight of a relevant 
policy area, such the Office of Employee and Labor Relations or the Office of 
Compliance, Risk and Ethics. For the purposes of this Procedure, if the 
recommendation comes from an administrator (or designee) outside the 
employee’s supervisory chain, that individual shall act as the “recommending 
supervisor.” 
III. Procedure for Appeal 
A. If the Director of Employee & Labor Relations adopts the recommendation for 
discharge, the employee may request an appeal hearing, in writing, within five (5) 
working days. Failure to request a hearing makes the discharge final. 
B. When requested, every effort shall be made to schedule the hearing within 
twenty (20) working days of the request, but extenuating circumstances may 
require an extension. 
Page 2 of 4 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34003CP 

C. The hearing panel shall be comprised of three (3) employees of the College, 
including at least one (1) administrator, who shall serve as the chair. The panel 
shall be selected in consultation with the Senior Vice President responsible for 
the unit in which the employee works, and the Office of Human Resources. 
D. The panel shall receive instruction on their role, responsibility, and procedure. 
E. The hearing is a non-judicial proceeding which is closed to the public. The 
proceeding will be recorded via audio recorder. 
F. At the hearing, both the recommending supervisor and the employee shall submit 
evidence and call witnesses, within reason, and as necessary. 
G. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing panel shall draft a 
recommendation to uphold, modify, or overturn the recommendation for 
discharge. Every effort shall be made to submit the draft within thirty (30) days of 
the hearing, but certain circumstances may require an extension. 
H. The hearing panel shall submit its recommendation to the Senior Vice President 
responsible for the area under which the employee works. 
I. The Senior Vice President may, in his or her sole discretion, accept the hearing 
panel recommendation as it is submitted, modify the recommendation, or 
overturn the recommendation. 
1. If dismissal is upheld, it shall take effect on the date specified in the 
notice for recommended discharge, or, if that date has passed, as 
specified by the Senior Vice President. 
2. If there is a modification of the recommendation, the modified course of 
action shall take effect as soon as is practicable. 
3. If the recommendation is overturned, the employee shall return to work 
as soon as is practicable with all applicable rights and privileges 
retroactively restored. 
IV. Discharge of Temporary Staff (with or without benefits) or Staff on Probationary Period 
A. Temporary or Probationary Staff may be discharged at any time, for any reason 
or no reason at all. Any supervisor in the employee’s supervisory chain may 
discharge a temporary or probationary employee. The supervisor may provide 
notice of the reasons for the decision, although providing reasoning is not 
required. 
B. The deciding supervisor shall notify both the Director of Employee & Labor 
Relations, or designee, and the Administrator in charge of the relevant unit, or 
designee, of any such discharge. 
C. Temporary and Probationary Staff do not have any right to appeal. 
D. The College shall have no obligation to Temporary or Probationary Staff who 
receive notice that regular status will not be granted prior to the end of the 
Page 3 of 4 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34003CP 

relevant temporary or probationary period. Temporary or Probationary Staff are 
not entitled to continue working through the end of the temporary or probationary 
period if such notice is given. 

V. The College’s Policies and Procedures, including this Policy, are not intended to 
constitute a contract of employment, or to confer any additional employment rights.

POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 34004 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 003 
Subject: Non-renewal of Administrative Appointment 

I. It is the policy of the Board of Trustees that the efficient operation of the institution 
mandates that all administrative staff be employed pursuant to written employment 
agreement generally with a one-year term. The agreement should contain a provision for 
timely notice of non-renewal. 
II. The President is authorized to establish procedures to implement this policy. 
Board Approval: September 21, 1987; January 25, 2005 (editorial); April 28, 2014.

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34004CP 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 004 
Subject: Non-renewal of Administrative Appointment 

I. General 
All administrators are employed pursuant to a written employment agreement which 
generally expires at the end of each fiscal year of the College. At least sixty calendar (60) 
days prior to the end of the employment term, the President, shall notify the administrator 
whether the administrator will be appointed for the next fiscal year, and, if so, provide the 
administrator with the employment agreement governing the terms and conditions of the 
appointment. The administrator may accept the appointment by signing and returning the 
employment agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days. The administrator’s failure or 
refusal to sign the employment agreement applicable to the new appointment shall not be 
deemed a non-renewal or create any right to the payment of severance. In the event that 
the administrator does not receive either notice of appointment for the following fiscal 
year or notice of non-renewal for the next fiscal year, at least sixty (60) calendar days 
before the end of the term, the employment agreement will renew on the same terms and 
conditions for the following fiscal year. The procedures specified below shall apply in the 
event of non-renewal of an administrative appointment. 

II. Procedures for Non-renewal 
A. Except for an administrator who reports directly to the President, a 
recommendation that the appointment of an administrator should not be renewed 
shall be made in writing by that administrator’s immediate supervisor and 
submitted to and reviewed by the President. The recommendation should 
include the specific reasons for the non-renewal. A copy of that recommendation 
shall be sent simultaneously to the affected administrator. In the case of an 
administrator who reports directly to the President, the President will notify the 
administrator of his/her impending non-renewal. 
B. An administrator recommended for non-renewal may, at the administrator’s 
request, meet with the President to discuss the matter. This meeting is for the 
purpose of providing the affected administrator an opportunity to state their 
position. Any such meeting shall be requested within ten (10) working days of the 
date of the recommendation. 
C. The President shall subsequently notify the administrator whether or not their 
appointment is being renewed. An administrator whose appointment is not being 
renewed shall also be notified of the terms of implementation of the non-renewal. 
D. At the request of the affected administrative staff employee, the President shall 
set forth, in writing, the reasons for non-renewal. 
E. An administrator notified of non-renewal may submit a written statement 
explaining their position on the non-renewal to the President and request that a 
copy of that statement be placed in their personnel file. 
F. Nothing in these procedures should be construed to mean that an administrator 
has a right to appeal non-renewal of a contract. 
Page 1 of 2 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34004CP 

III. Effect of Notice of Non-renewal 
A. If notice of non-renewal is given, the notice shall state the terms of 
implementation of the non-renewal. 
B. Nothing in these procedures shall be construed to prevent an employee notified 
of non-renewal from resigning prior to the specified effective date of non-renewal. 
In such case, unless otherwise specified, the College shall have no further 
obligation to the employee after the effective date of the resignation.

POLICY Board of Trustees -Montgomery College 34101 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 002 
Subject: Grievance Process for Non-Bargaining Staff 

I. The Board of Trustees recognizes the need for a grievance process for non-bargaining 
staff employees to assure that employee complaints regarding working conditions, 
disciplinary actions or alleged violations of policy and/or procedures receive prompt and 
careful consideration and are resolved in an equitable manner. Prior to filing a formal 
grievance, employees are required to make every effort to settle such matters informally 
in the normal system of supervision and administration. The purpose of grievance 
procedures is to make maximum effort to secure equitable solutions to grievance matters 
at the lowest possible administrative level. 
II. The President is authorized to establish procedures to implement this policy. 
Board Approval: September 21, 1987; April 8, 2019.

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34101CP 

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 005 
Subject: Grievance Process for Non-Bargaining Staff 

I. Grievance -General 
A. Purpose: The internal grievance process is a tool for employees to formally raise 
concerns and it provides supervisors a process to address those concerns. The goal of 
the process is to give employees the opportunity to be heard and to ensure that careful 
consideration is given to decisions affecting employees. The College offers this tool, 
among others, including the Ombuds, and employees are encouraged to engage with the 
option that works best for them. 
B. Definition: A grievance is a complaint in regard to working conditions, disciplinary 
actions, or alleged violations of policy and/or procedures that do not have a specific 
complaint procedure. 
C. The following are exempt from the grievance procedure: 
1. An employee's performance evaluation. 
2. The content of published policy of the College. 
3. An action terminating a temporary promotion and returning the employee to the 
employee's previous position. 
4. Matters which are subject to appeal under any other established appeal 
procedure authorized elsewhere in College policies and procedures, including 
but not limited to 31006CP-Equal Opportunity, Non-Discrimination, 31001CPSexual 
Misconduct, and 34003CP-Discharge of Administrators and Staff. 
5. Decisions on the status of probationary and temporary employees (e.g., whether 
or not to grant regular status, continued funding or need for the position, etc.) 
6. Administrators are not eligible to file grievances under this procedure. 
D. An employee, in presenting a grievance under this grievance procedure, shall: 
1. Be assured freedom from discrimination or retaliation. 
2. Have the right to be accompanied by an employee representative who has been 
freely chosen and is willing and free to accompany the employee; the 
accompanying employee should not be involved in a conflict of position, such as 
might be the case with a member of the Human Resources Office or the Office of 
Equity and Inclusion. 
a. When an employee designates another employee of the College as an 
accompanying employee, the accompanying employee shall be assured 
freedom from discrimination or retaliation. 
b. An employee may choose to present a grievance without an 
accompanying employees. 
Page 1 of 3 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34101CP 

E. All decisions rendered at all levels of the grievance procedure shall be in writing setting 
forth the decision and shall be transmitted promptly to all of the principal parties involved 
in the grievance and its adjudication. 
F. Each supervisory level shall give each grievance full, impartial, and prompt consideration. 
Every effort shall be made to issue responses within fifteen (15) working days. The Chief 
Human Resources Officer may grant an appropriate extension under extenuating 
circumstances. 
II. STEP I: Informal Process 
The employee should report the grievance to the employee’s immediate supervisor or the 
supervisor’s immediate supervisor within ten (10) working days from the date of the incident or 
the date the employee became aware of the incident. The employee should describe the 
incident, explain the problem, and suggest a solution whenever possible. Every effort should be 
made to resolve the problem at this stage. If a satisfactory solution is not reached within ten (10) 
working days of notice to the supervisory chain, the employee may then proceed to request 
Alternative Dispute Resolution or file a formal grievance. 

A. An employee is entitled to present a formal grievance only after informal resolution has 
been attempted, unless the informal requirement has been waived by the Director of 
Employee and Labor Relations (or designee) or college policy and procedure states 
otherwise. 
B. An employee may, as part of the informal process, take advantage of other College 
resources, such as the Ombudsman, Employee & Labor Relations, or the Faculty & Staff 
Assistance Program, to help resolve the grievance. 
III. STEP II: Alternative Dispute Resolution 
In the event a dispute is not resolved during the informal process, an employee or the College 
may request the assistance of a mediator to resolve the grievance. Such a request must be made 
to the Office of Employee & Labor Relations within five (5) working days of conclusion of the 
informal procedure. In no case shall an employee who works in the same unit be appointed to 
help resolve the dispute. 

IV. STEP III: Formal Grievance Procedure 
A. If the matter is not resolved, within five (5) working days of the conclusion of the 
informal process and/or Alternative Dispute Resolution, the employee may submit the 
formal grievance, in writing, to his/her next-level supervisor (i.e., the supervisor of the 
employee’s immediate supervisor), with a copy to the Director of Employee & Labor 
Relations (or designee). The formal grievance must include a description of the 
problem, the basis of the grievance including prior attempts to remedy the situation, 
and a proposed remedy (if the latter is practicable). 
B. The next-level supervisor shall consult with the Office of Employee & Labor Relations 
as part of the review. 
C. The next-level supervisor may request a meeting with the employee or additional 
information from the employee. The next-level supervisor may also meet with other 
employees in the unit as needed. 
Page 2 of 3 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 34101CP 

D. Upon conclusion of the review, the next-level supervisor shall issue a response in 
writing to the employee, usually within ten (10) working days of the conclusion of the 
review. 
1. The response shall include whether the grievance is upheld or denied or other 
action will be taken in response, and the basis for the decision. 
2. A copy of the response shall be submitted to the Director of Employee & Labor 
Relations (or designee). 
E. If the employee’s next-level supervisor is a senior vice president, then that senior vice 
president’s review shall be final and the employee will have no further appeal as outlined 
below. 
V. STEP IV: Formal Appeal 
A. An employee may appeal the Formal Grievance to the responsible administrator for the 
unit. The responsible administrator will be the lowest-level administrator that has not 
already been involved in a prior step in the procedure (e.g., typically a Director or Vice 
President). The employee must submit the Formal Grievance Appeal and all related 
document to the responsible administrator within five (5) working days, with a copy to 
the Director of Employee & Labor Relations (or designee). The responsible 
administrator will be the lowest-level administrator that has not already been involved in 
a prior step in this procedure (e.g., usually a Director or Vice President) 
B. The responsible administrator shall consult with the Office of Employee & Labor 
Relations as part of the review. 
C. The responsible administrator may request a meeting with the employee or additional 
information from the employee. The responsible administrator may also meet with 
other employees in the unit as needed. 
D. Upon conclusion of the review, the responsible administrator shall issue a response in 
writing to the employee, usually within ten (10) working days of the conclusion of the 
review. The response shall include whether the grievance is upheld or denied or other 
action will be taken in response, and the basis for the decision. A copy of the 
response shall be submitted to the Director of Employee & Labor Relations (or 
designee). 
E. The responsible administrator’s review shall be final.

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 008 
Subject: Compensation Programs 

I. Montgomery College’s compensation program is designed to attract and retain high 
performing and highly skilled faculty, staff, and administrators. The College recognizes 
the contributions of each employee in achieving the College’s Mission. The total 
compensation philosophy considers both internal and external market factors in 
determining pay. The external market consists of both academic institutions and general 
industry employers with whom the College competes for employees. 
II. As part of the College's compensation programs, the Board has authorized a total 
compensation program, subject to the availability of funding, to include such items as 
salary, educational assistance, tuition waiver, health and life insurance, retirement, and 
tax shelter annuities.

and changes for non-bargaining staff. 
D. Salary for faculty and bargaining staff are subject to their respective collective 
bargaining agreements. 
II. Salary Schedules for Staff and Administrators 
A. Salary Schedule Structure 
Salary schedules for all staff and administrators shall be structured to provide 
stratified differentials between successive grade levels and range lengths. The 
grades recognize difference in market value and the scope and complexity of the 
work performed; the range lengths recognize the development of knowledge, 
skills, and experience with the grade assignment as well as the length of service 
of the employee. 

B. Adjustments for Labor Market Rates 
When the established range or salary is significantly below or above competitive 
rates of pay, additional salary ranges for a staff occupational class may be 
authorized by the Chief Human Resources Officer and special salary 
adjustments for administrators may be authorized by the President to meet 
competitive salaries in relevant labor markets. 

C. General Wage Adjustments (GWA) 
1. The President recommends, each fiscal year, for Board approval, 
general wage adjustments for administrators and non-bargaining staff. 
2. General wage adjustments for bargaining unit employees are established 
through the collective bargaining process. Amendments to the collective 
bargaining agreements are recommended by the President for Board 
approval. 
III. Initial Salary Placement for Administrators and Staff

such as degrees earned, years of relevant experience, relevant job market, and 
internal equity among other similar administrator salaries. Salary placements, as 
Page 1 of 23 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 35001CP 

well as appointments, for administrator candidates will be subject to the approval 
of the President, or designee. 

B. The initial salary of a staff employee is determined by the Chief Human 
Resources Officer, or designee, based on review of degrees earned, years of 
relevant experience, relevant job market, and internal equity among staff salaries 
within the same or comparable occupational classes. 
C. Initial salary placement will be made in accordance with established pay 
guidelines. 
IV. Within-Grade Pay Adjustments 
A. An administrator may request a salary review of a staff employee to resolve a 
pay inequity. With the approval of the Chief Human Resources Officer, or 
designee, the Office of Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management 
(HRSTM) may conduct an equity review by examining the employee’s salary 
history, relevant experience, education, job performance, length of service, and 
certifications/licenses compared to other employees in the same occupational 
class. 
B. Any proposed pay adjustment resulting from an equity review must be approved 
by the SVP for Administrative and Fiscal Services and the Chief Business-
Financial Strategy Officer, and may not create pay inequities among other 
employees. Any adjustment resulting from the review will be effective at the 
beginning of the pay period. 
V. Overtime Pay for Staff Employees 
A. Definition. Overtime is defined as hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a work 
week. Only those hours actually worked shall be included in computing the 40 
hours for overtime pay purposes. 
Overtime for bargaining unit employees will be determined in accordance with 
the collective bargaining agreement. 

A staff employee may work more than 8 hours in one day at the regular rate of 
pay to accommodate an alternative work schedule, special job requirements or to 
make up for hours absent during the same week provided that: 

1. Such an arrangement is requested for the employee's own convenience, 
with the understanding that the employee will not be paid time and 
one-half, and that the supervisor consents to the arrangement; or 
2. If the alternative work schedule requires the establishment of a different 
workweek, an alternative workweek agreement shall be completed and 
forwarded to the Office of Human Resources and Strategic Talent 
Management (HRSTM); or 
3. The supervisor requests that the employee work more than 8 hours 
because of special job requirements, and the employee consents to the 
arrangement; and 
Page 2 of 19 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 35001CP 

4. No more than 40 hours are worked in the week. 
B. Nonexempt Employees. Employees designated as nonexempt in accordance 
with the Fair Labor Standards Act shall be compensated for hours worked in 
excess of 40 hours in a work week. The rate of pay for overtime worked by a 
nonexempt employee shall be one and one-half times the employee's regular 
rate of pay. 
C. Exempt Employees. Employees designated as exempt in accordance with the 
Fair Labor Standards Act are not eligible for overtime pay. Exempt employees 
who work in excess of the number of normally scheduled hours on a particular 
day may, upon approval by the supervisor, reduce a workday in consideration of 
the time worked on an hour-by-hour basis within the same pay period. See 
College Procedure 32305CP-Working Hours for Staff Employees. 
D. Approval for Overtime. All overtime must be approved in advance by the first-line 
administrator. However, a non-exempt employee must be paid for hours worked 
above 40 hours in a work week even if the overtime was not approved. In this 
situation, the supervisor may take appropriate action to prevent further violation 
of this policy. Supervisors must maintain adequate documentation and 
accurately certify time records.

Resources Officer who will review the request. The Chief Human Resources 
Officer will forward the recommendation to the Senior Vice President for 
Administrative and Fiscal Services and the Chief Financial Strategy Officer who 
will make the final decision. 
D. All requests, submitted on a completed Special Project Pay request form, must 
provide specific justification for each of the criterion as either a medium project

request to extend the Special Project Pay adjustment must be submitted in 
accordance with the initial approval process at least 30 days prior to the 
expiration of the original timeline. 
VII. Night Shift Differential Pay for Nonexempt Staff Employees 
Nonexempt staff employees who are employed to work regularly 20 or more hours per 
week and who are regularly scheduled to work between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 6:30

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 35001CP 

provided below. 

This decision shall be made by the President for administrators and by the Chief 
Human Resources Officer or designee for staff. 

D. Selection of employees to serve as acting or on an interim basis should be based 
on the broadest possible internal pool to facilitate the maximum opportunity for 
those seeking professional development opportunities to be considered. 
Employees who are temporarily assigned to a vacant position are categorized as 
“interim.” Employees who are temporarily assigned to a filled position where the 
incumbent is on leave or temporarily performing the duties and responsibilities of 
another position are categorized as “acting.” 
E. If an employee has been satisfactorily performing the duties assigned to a vacant 
position for at least one year, meets the minimum requirements for the job class, 
and a recruitment effort has not been initiated, the President (for Administrators)

and responsibilities normally performed by a position at the same or a lesser pay 
grade. 
G. A recommendation for a temporary salary adjustment to assume higher level 
duties and responsibilities will normally be made by the employee’s immediate 
supervisor to the Chief Human Resources Officer (or designee) who will review 
the request. For administrators, the Chief Human Resources Officer will make a 
recommendation to the president, who will make the final decision. For staff, 
Chief Human Resources Officer (or designee) will make the final decision.

in salaries as determined appropriate by the president. In such cases, the president will 
notify administrators and staff in writing, as promptly as possible regarding the first day 
the reductions are to take effect, the amount of the reductions, and the necessity for such 
action. 

XVIII. Furlough Days 
In the event of a budget or funding shortfall or other fiscal constraints, the President may 
determine unpaid hours off (“furloughs”) are appropriate. In such cases, the President or 
his/her designee will notify administrators and staff, and, where applicable as a result of 
collective bargaining, bargaining unit employees in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to 
the implementation of furlough days. The President or his/her designee shall also inform 
affected employees of the current number of furlough days designated in the fiscal year 
and whether such furlough days shall be “fixed” or “individually designated” or a 
combination thereof. Fixed furloughs are designated as unpaid hours occurring for all 
employees on the same day which results in operations being suspended at the College. 
Individually designated furloughs are a designated number of unpaid hours not fixed on a 
particular day. The President or his/her designee shall also inform employees as to the 
lawful method of pay reduction associated with the furlough days, including whether the

deadline. 
5. Reimbursement and Reporting Procedures 
a. Payment must be requested by submitting an original invoice or 
paid receipt with a copy of the approved request to the Office of 
Human Resources, Development, and Engagement. After 
approval by the Office of Human Resources, Development, and 
Engagement the invoice or original receipt is sent with a copy of 
the original request to the Finance Office for processing and 
reimbursement to the employee or payment to the institution. 
Since Montgomery College is a tax exempt institution, tax is not 
reimbursable. 
b. To be eligible for continued financial benefits under EAP, the 
employee must have a record of satisfactory completion of study 
for which he/she has received EAP benefits. 
c. Employees who do not satisfactorily complete study for which

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 016 
Subject: Leave Program 

I. Leave with Pay for Non-Bargaining Administrators and Staff 
A. Sick and Safe Leave 
Sick and safe leave is a designated amount of compensated leave that may be 
granted to eligible administrators and staff who through personal illness, 
temporary disability, injury, or quarantine are unable to perform the duties of their 
positions. Sick and safe leave may also be used when an employee requires 
leave from work when there has been domestic violence, sexual assault, or 

stalking against the employee or an eligible member of the employee’s family for 


receipt of medical or mental health attention, receipt of services from a victim 
services organization, participation in legal services or proceedings, or for a 
temporary relocation. Sick and safe leave may also include other excused 
absences such as those for medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment 
impossible to schedule on non-duty days. In addition, sick and safe leave may 
be used for illness in the immediate family if the employee's attendance is 
required (see below). Sick and safe leave may not be granted for the duration of 
any disability when monies are paid to the employee under the Workers' 
Compensation laws. 

1. Eligibility 
Each employee who regularly works 12 hours per week or more shall 
earn sick and safe leave.

the employee’s family member; 


3) To care for a family member with a mental or physical 
illness, injury or condition;

services organization, legal services (or participate in 
legal proceedings), or during the time the employee has 
temporarily located for the reasons of domestic violence, 
sexual assault, or stalking committed against the 
employee or the employee’s family member. 


b. Family member includes: 
1) A child (biological, adopted, foster, or step) of the 
employee; 
2) A child for whom the employee has legal or physical 
custody or guardianship or for whom the employee 
stands in loco parentis regardless of the child’s age; 


3) A parent (biological, adoptive, foster, step, or individual 
who acted or stood in loco parentis) of the employee or

employee; 
8) Grandparent (biological, adopted, foster, or step) of the 
employee; or 
9) Grandchild (biological, adopted, foster, or step) of the 
employee. 
4. Use of Sick and Safe Leave 
a. A request for sick and safe leave, when the need for such leave 
is foreseeable (i.e. surgery, medical appointments), should be 
initiated by the employee prior to the desired leave period. The 
employee shall apply in writing through appropriate supervisory 
channels to the supervising administrator (or designee) of the 
employee. 
b. When the need for sick and safe leave is not foreseeable, the 
employee is responsible for providing notice to the employee’s 
supervisor as soon as practicable. Unless physically impossible, 
this reporting should be accomplished before or during the 
working hours of the first day of such sick and safe leave. 
Page 2 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

c. Sick and safe leave may be used only after it has been earned 
and credited to the employee's account. See Advancement of 
Sick and Safe Leave for exception to this provision. 
d. Leave Accrual 
1) For Regular Full-Time (40 hours a week), Regular Part-
Time (less than 40 hours a week but no less than 20 
hour a week), and Temporary Employees with Benefits 
unused sick and safe leave may be accumulated and 
carried forward year to year. 
2) All other eligible employees may earn up to 40 hours of 
sick and safe leave in a year, use up to 64 hours of sick 
and safe leave in a year, and accrue up to 64 hours of 
sick and safe leave at any time. These employees may 
carry over up to 40 hours of sick and safe leave year to 
year. An employee will not accrue sick and safe leave 
during a pay period in which the employee worked fewer 
than 24 hours. 
e. Use of Sick and Safe Leave While on Annual Leave. When an 
employee becomes ill or disabled while on annual leave, the 
employee may use accumulated sick and safe leave provided 
the supervisor is notified as soon as possible and the employee 
submits to the Office of Human Resources satisfactory evidence 
confirming the illness or disability. 
f. Transfer of Accumulated Sick and Safe Leave. An employee 
who transfers from one College position to another (staff, 
administrator or faculty) shall retain the accumulated sick and 
safe leave balance or any indebtedness for advanced sick and 
safe leave which may have incurred. 
g. Verification of Sick and Safe Leave Use. Each supervisor is 
responsible for reviewing the use of sick and safe leave by each 
employee under his or her supervision. If an employee uses sick 
or safe leave for more than three consecutive scheduled days 
and/or times, the supervisor may contact the Chief Human 
Resources Officer, or designee, who may request written 
verification of the 
employee’s sick and safe leave. The 
College 
may deny a subsequent leave request made by an employee 
who does not provide verification if the subsequent leave request 
is for the same reason as the leave for which the employee did 
not provide verification. 
h. If an employee's use of sick and safe leave appears excessive or 
questionable, the supervisor shall contact the Chief Human 
Resources Officer, or designee, who may discuss the 
employee’s sick and safe 
leave use with the 
employee. 
i. Denial of Sick and Safe Leave. A request to take sick and safe 
leave may be denied if an employee fails to provide notice 

Page 3 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

pursuant to a. and b. above and if the 
employee’s absence will 
cause a disruption. 

j. Employees are prohibited from improperly using earned sick and 
safe leave and may not abuse sick and safe leave. . 
5. Advancement of Sick and Safe Leave 
a. Regular full-time, part-time, and temporary with benefits 
employees are eligible for advancement of sick and safe leave. 
Upon recommendation of the employee's supervisor, an 
advancement to an employee of unearned sick and safe leave 
with pay not to exceed the amount to be earned during the next 
succeeding twelve (12) months may be approved by the Chief 
Human Resources Officer or designee. 
b. As a condition for the advancement of sick and safe leave, the 
employee shall agree in writing that, if the employee’s 
employment with the College terminates before the employee 
has accrued the amount of sick and safe leave that was used, 
the College is authorized to deduct the amount paid for 
advanced sick and safe leave from the employee’s final 


paycheck. 

c. In the event the employee's final pay is insufficient to cover such 
indebtedness, the employee shall be billed for the remaining 
balance of such indebtedness and shall make arrangements for 
payment satisfactory to the College. If, because of long-term 
disability or death, the indebtedness cannot be eliminated, it 
shall be written off. 
6. Disposition of Accumulated Sick and Safe Leave at Termination of 
Employment 
a. All employees initially hired after January 1, 1993, are not 
entitled to compensation for unused sick and safe leave. 
b. An regular or temporary with benefits employee hired prior to 
January 1, 1993, who resigns from the service of the College 
after completion of at least five consecutive years of service 
immediately preceding such separation shall be paid for twenty-
five percent (25%) of not more than one hundred eighty (180) 
days of unused sick and safe leave computed on the basis of 
salary at termination; except that staff members who, as of 
June 30, 1987, have accumulated in excess of one hundred 
eighty (180) days of unused sick and safe leave, shall be paid at 
the time of termination for twenty-five percent (25%) of the 
unused sick and safe leave accumulated by such staff member 
as of June 30, 1987 or the date of termination, whichever is less. 
An employee who is dismissed from employment with the 
College is not entitled to this lump sum payment. 
c. Earned but unused sick and safe leave will be reinstated for 
Page 4 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

employees who leave the College and are not paid out earned 
but unused sick and safe leave if the employee is rehired within

leave earned during these first 30 days of employment 
b. Effective January 1, 1997, an employee who leaves the service 
of the College after completion of 30 calendar days of 
employment shall receive a lump-sum payment for all accrued 
but unused annual leave at the terminal salary rate, but not to 
exceed the employee's annual leave accrual rate. 
4. Use of Annual Leave 
a. Annual leave may not be used during the first 30 calendar days 
of employment unless pre-arranged as a condition of 
employment or in exceptional cases approved by the Vice 
President of Human Resources, Development, and Engagement 
or designee. After the first 30 calendar days of employment, 
leave may be used only after it has been earned and credited to 
the employee's account. 
b. Annual leave shall be scheduled by the appropriate supervisor at 
such time(s) as may be deemed to be in the best interest of the 
College. Generally, blocks of annual leave for ten-month 
employees should be scheduled during periods when faculty are 
not on duty. 
c. A request for annual leave should be initiated by the employee 
prior to the desired leave period. The employee shall apply 
through appropriate supervisory channels to the supervising 
administrator of his or her unit on the Request for Short-term 
Leave Form. The supervising administrator (or designee) shall

his/her supervisor as early as possible that he/she will be unable 
to report for work, stating the reason for the absence and his/her 
desire to use annual leave. The Request for Short-term Leave 
Form should be completed and submitted immediately upon 
return from the leave period. See also the "liberal leave" 
provisions in the procedures regarding "Emergency Closing of

year's entitlement of earned annual leave during each year. 
5. Accrual and Accumulation of Annual Leave

Page 6 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

follows: i) for employees with less than three years of service, 
120 hours; ii) for employees with more than three years of 
service but less than 15 years, 160 hours; iii) for employees with 
15 or more years of service, 208 hours. The maximum and 
carryover amount will be prorated for assignments of less than 
40 hours per week. 

b. Any leave in excess of the maximum amount carried forward to 
the next year, in accordance with b. above, shall be lost at 12:01 
am on the first day of the first pay period to be paid in January. 
6. Creditable Service 
Creditable service for use in determining an employee's annual accrual 
rate for annual leave shall include all authorized paid leave, authorized 
leave without pay for military service or self-improvement, and the time a 
regular employee is on approved disability leave. In computing the sum 
for creditable service, no credit shall be given for any month in which an 
employee was employed fewer than 15 calendar days. 

7. Transfer of Accumulated Leave or Indebtedness 
An employee who transfers from one College position to another (staff or 
administrator) shall retain his/her accumulated annual leave balance or

incurred. 

8. Excluded Service 
Periods of layoff and suspension and periods of authorized leave without 
pay in excess of two months (60 calendar days) shall not be credited for 
use in determining annual leave accrual rate. The only exceptions are 
leave without pay for military service, for self-improvement, and for 
disability. 

C. Holidays 
Eligible employees are authorized paid leave on official holidays when such 
holidays fall on days which they are regularly scheduled to work. Such leave is 

referred to as “holiday leave.” Official 
holidays are those days designated 
each 

year in the College calendar (See 58001 College Calendar) on which the College 
is listed as being closed, including the Saturdays and Sundays. There shall be 
designated either fourteen or fifteen holidays during a fiscal year, or a number as 
authorized by the president when determined to be in the best interest of the 
College. 

1. Eligibility 
Each administrative, associate, and support staff employee who is 
assigned to a regular position or a temporary with benefits positions and 
who works a regularly scheduled 20 hours per week or more shall be

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

2. Work on Holidays 
An employee may be required to work on an official holiday if a 
determination is made that certain College services must be maintained. 
The president, the appropriate Vice President shall determine which 
College services must be maintained and each unit head concerned 
shall determine which employees work and which employees do not 
work on the holiday involved. See 35001CP, Compensation, Staff Pay 
for Work on a Holiday 

3. When an Official Holiday Falls 
on a Staff 
Employee’s 
Regular Day 
Off 
When an official holiday falls on an employee’s regularly scheduled day 


off, such employee shall not be paid for that day. However, in those 
situations where an alternate work schedule serves to reduce a full-time 

employee’s number of paid holidays below the minimum number 

received by those working a regular work schedule, the employee so 
affected will receive an alternate paid holiday for the hours he/she are 
normally scheduled to work during the same pay period or the 
subsequent pay period, unless the needs of the College require that the 
day off be taken at a later time. 

4. Holiday Falling During Periods of Other Authorized Leave 
When an official holiday falls during a period of either annual or sick 
leave, it is counted as a day of holiday leave. 

5. Alternate Work Schedules & Holidays 
In those situations where an alternate work schedule serves to reduce a 
full-time employee’s number of paid holidays below the minimum number 
received by those working a regular work schedule, the person so 
affected will receive an alternate paid holiday for the hours he/she are 
normally scheduled to work during the same pay period or the 
subsequent pay period, unless the needs of the College require that the 
day off be taken at a later time. 

6. Part-Time Employees working 20 hours or more 
Part-time employees shall be paid for holidays for the number of hours 
that they are regularly scheduled to work on those days. In the event a 
part-time employee is not scheduled to work on a holiday, the employee 
shall not be paid for that day. 

D. Personal Leave 
1. Eligibility 
Each administrative, associate, and support staff employee who is 
assigned to a regular position or a temporary-with-benefits position and 
who works a regularly scheduled 20 hours per week or more shall earn 
personal leave.

2. Entitlement 
An eligible employee may be granted personal leave (non-cumulative) 
with pay up to a maximum of 24 hours for full-time employees and on a 
prorated basis for part-time employees during each leave year. Personal 
leave will be granted for the purpose of allowing the employee to attend 
to special personal obligations such as major religious observances, 
settlement on the sale or purchase of property, appearance in court other 
than for a staff member who is subpoenaed as a court witness or who is 
called to serve on a jury, lawyer appointments, or for other important

personal property. 

3. Application Procedures 
The employee shall submit, in advance, if possible, a request for 
personal leave on the Staff Request for Short-term Leave Form through 
the employee's immediate supervisor to the supervising administrator (or 
designee) for approval. Employees will be on an honor system to 
request personal leave for appropriate reasons; therefore, no detailed 
explanation will be required. 

E. Leave for Professional Meetings 
Leave for professional meetings is paid leave granted for the purpose of 
attending off-campus professional meetings (e.g. conventions, conferences, or 
committees as participant or observer), participation in which requires distant 
travel or absence of one day or more. The term "Professional Meetings" also 
includes other college business which requires distant travel. Requests for this 
type of leave are submitted on Request for Short-term Leave Form and forward it 
to the supervising administrator (or designee) for action. 

F. Bereavement Leave 
An eligible employee shall be entitled to leave with pay for five (5) work days, not 
to exceed 40 hours, in the case of the death of a member of the employee's 
immediate family. “Immediate family member” is defined as spouse; natural, 
foster, or stepchild; in-law; parent; step-parent; sibling; grandchild; grandparent; 

or member of the employee’s immediate household. Leave need not be taken 
on 


consecutive days provided such leave is taken during the period between the 
date of death and the conclusion of the mourning period or date of burial. The 
employee shall submit the appropriate short-term leave form to the supervising 
administrator (or designee) for action. 

G. Court Attendance Leave

serve on a jury may be granted court attendance leave for the period he or she is 
required to be in court plus necessary travel time.

her absence by the submission of an official statement from the court 
indicating the exact duration of the employee's court service. 
3. Any pay (less travel or other necessary and uncompensated expenses) 
received by the employee for such court service shall be paid to the 
College unless the employee elects to use annual leave or leave without 
pay, in which case the employee may retain all pay received for such 
court service. 
H. Annual Military Reserve Training Leave 
An eligible employee who is a member of the National Guard or of the United 
States Armed Forces Reserves may be granted special leave with pay for 
training purposes not to exceed 15 calendar days in any 12-month period when 
required by federal or state order. In addition, such leave with pay as may be 
required may be granted to an employee when his or her reserve unit is activated 
by federal or state order in the event of a civil disturbance or other emergency. 

1. The employee shall submit the appropriate short-term leave form through 
appropriate supervisory channels to the Vice President of Human 
Resources, Development, and Engagement (or designee). A copy of the 
military or other governmental orders shall be attached to the request. 
2. Any pay (less extra travel or other necessary and uncompensated 
expenses) received by the employee for such active duty shall be paid to 
the College unless the employee elects to use annual leave or leave 
without pay, in which case the employee may retain all pay received for 
such active duty. 
I. Administrative Leave 
College employees may be granted paid leave when the safety, health, or 
general welfare of the employee is in danger or when such leave is deemed to be 
in the best interest of the College. Administrative leave may be granted on either 
an institution-wide basis or to selected segments of the staff of the College as 
follows: 

1. When conditions justify administrative leave on an institution-wide, 
campus or central office basis, the President (or designee) authorizes 
such leave. 
2. When conditions justify granting administrative leave to only selected 
offices or personnel of the College staff, such authorization shall be 
made by the Vice President of Human Resources, Development, and 
Engagement or designee upon the recommendation of the appropriate 
administrator for the organizational unit involved. 
3. Notification 
When administrative leave is authorized, it shall be announced in writing 
by the authorizing official no later than the first working day following the 
authorization decision. The notification shall identify those employees 

Page 10 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

entitled to use such leave. 

4. Administrative Leave -Institution-Wide, Campus or Central Office 
When administrative leave is authorized for all employees of the College, 
or a major segment thereof, it shall apply to all affected employees who 
are on the payroll in a work status or who are on annual or sick leave. If 
such leave happens to fall on an employee's normal day off, it shall not 
apply for that employee. 

5. Administrative Leave -Selected Offices or Personnel 
When administrative leave is authorized for selected offices or personnel 
of the College, only those employees so identified, and who are on the 
payroll in a work or paid leave status, shall be entitled to use such leave. 
If such leave happens to fall on a normal day off for any such employee, 
it shall not apply for that employee. 

6. Required Work During Periods of Administrative Leave 
Those employees who are required to work in order to service and 
protect those portions of College property affected by the authorized 
administrative leave shall be paid for such work in the same manner as 
employees are paid for work performed on an official holiday. 

J. Extended Professional Development Leave 
1. General 
Extended professional development leave for administrative, associate, 
and support staff will normally be granted for a period of three months or 
one semester and will be at full pay. Exceptions to this framework will be 
considered on an individual basis. 

2. Eligibility 
Staff become eligible to apply for and are considered for professional 
development leave after they have served continuously at Montgomery

b. Employee Status An administrative, associate, or support staff 
employee on extended professional development leave shall for 
all purposes, including but not limited to benefits and applicability 
of the College conflict of interest policy, be viewed as a full-time 
employee, except that annual leave and sick leave may not be 
earned or used while on professional development leave. 
c. Contractual Agreement An administrative, associate, or support 
staff employee granted extended professional development 
leave shall enter into a written agreement whereby he/she 
agrees to return to service at Montgomery College for a period of

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

the College all monies paid to him/her on his/her behalf during

than those specified in the approved program) for which payment 
is received shall not be allowed unless specifically approved by 
the Vice President of Human Resources, Development, and 
Engagement (or designee), who is responsible for administering 
the terms of the agreement. 

d. Change of Status Due to Inability to Complete Program If the 
staff employee cannot complete the planned program for which 
the extended professional development leave was granted, it is 
the employee's responsibility to notify promptly the Vice 
President of Human Resources, Development, and Engagement

d. Upon completion of extended professional development leave, 
an associate or support staff employee shall immediately return 
to the same position held prior to such leave unless, by mutual 
agreement in advance of the employee's return, it is decided to 
place the returning employee in a different position. 
K. Extended Administrative Leave 
Extended administrative leave is defined as that type of personnel development 
leave authorized and assigned an administrative, associate, or support staff 
employee to benefit the College. College personnel are placed on extended 
administrative leave only to acquire a set of skills or specific knowledge required 
for the operation of the College. Placement of an individual on such leave, and 
the financial arrangements therefore, must be approved by the President. 
Extended administrative leave will not be used when other methods such as 
independent or self-programmed study or educational (tuition) assistance will 
provide the skill needed in the time frame involved. When the criteria for the 
Educational Assistance Program are met, the program may be used in 
conjunction with extended administrative leave, with the approval of the 
President. 

1. Eligibility. 
Page 14 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

Any individual currently employed full-time by the College may be placed 
on extended administrative leave provided that the person is willing and 
that, normally, the person has been in the service of the College for at 
least four (4) consecutive years. Declining the offer to be placed on this 
leave will not affect the person's employment status at the College. 

2. Application Procedure 
a. Although normally initiated at the supervisory level, any member 
of the College may recommend that extended administrative 
leave be granted to one or more eligible persons or for one or 
more purposes. If not originating with the President, a vice 
president/provost, or Senior Vice President, the request will be 
forwarded through supervisory channels to the appropriate 
aforementioned major supervisor. 
b. The request should explain the purpose of the leave, state how it 
will benefit the operation of the College, explain why it is 
necessary or essential for the College to authorize this type of 
leave, provide a specific cost estimate, recommend an 
individual(s) to be on the leave, list any prior leave for 
professional meetings or extended administrative leave granted 
to that person during the prior 12 months, and indicate the 
willingness of the individual(s) to be placed on leave if it is 
granted. 
c. The major supervisor concerned will review the request, make a 
recommendation, and forward it to the Vice President of Human 
Resources, Development, and Engagement or designee for 
consideration and recommendation to the President for final 
approval or disapproval. 
d. When extended administrative leave has been authorized by the 
President, application for leave will be made administratively on 
the Request for Funds for Distant Travel form. 
3. Salary and Benefits. All salary and benefits normally received will 
continue when a person is placed on extended administrative leave. In 
addition, travel, and allowance for room and board may be paid by the 
College, as warranted, and will be determined in advance by mutual 
agreement between the individual and the Chief Business Officer, and be 
approved by the President. 
4. Contractual Agreement. An individual who agrees to be placed on 
extended administrative leave must contract to return to the College 
upon its completion for twice the duration of the leave but in no case less 
than the equivalent of half of an academic year. Failure to return and 
serve will make the individual liable for all monies paid to him/her or on 
his/her behalf by the College, unless relieved of this obligation, in part or 
in full, by the President for such reasons as disability or death. 
5. Duration of Leave. Extended administrative leave is normally for no 
more than the equivalent of a semester. The minimum duration of 
Page 15 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

extended administrative leave will usually be more than two weeks. 
Personal development leave of two weeks or less will normally be 
considered under the category of short-term leave to attend professional 
meetings. Although extended administrative leave will usually be for 
periods in excess of two weeks, an individual's daily absence over a 
continued period of time while on extended administrative leave might 
well be for only a fraction of a working day; for example, two hours per 
day for six weeks. 

6. Credited Service. An individual on extended leave will have the time of 
authorized absence count toward employment status and will return to 
the same or equivalent position on return from leave. 
L. Short-Term Disability Leave for Administrative, Associate and Support Staff 
1. Disability Not Compensable Under Workers’ Compensation Law. 
A staff employee who works at least half-time with regular status (as 
opposed to temporary status) in a budgeted position on a continuing

employee’s discretion and upon approval 
of the employee’s immediate 


supervisor, an employee may request the use of advanced sick leave 
between the exhaustion of all accrued sick leave and the 
commencement of disability leave. This request must be made and 
approved prior to the commencement of Disability Leave and is a non-
revocable decision for that period of disability)., shall be entitled to leave, 
commencing on the first day after the exhaustion of sick leave and 
continuing to the first anniversary of the date he/she was first unable to 
work of such disability. A staff employee shall be remunerated for the

of acceptable medical documentation, may be permitted to engage in 
rehabilitative work (defined as returning to work for fewer hours than the 
employee was regularly scheduled before leave commenced) for up to 
the term of the employee’s 
short-term disability period. An employee 
shall be remunerated for the period that he or she is permitted to engage 
in rehabilitative work pursuant to this section in an amount equal to the 

percentage 
of the employee’s regular rate provided in the above 
schedule, plus an additional twenty (20) percent of the employee’s 


regular rate. An employee engaged in rehabilitative work shall accrue 
leave on a pro rata basis and shall be permitted to use leave on a pro

Compensation law, who is treated for such disability by a 
health care provider other than a College designated 

Workers’ Compensation 
provider, shall be entitled to 


leave, commencing on the first day he/she is unable to 
work because of such disability and continuing to the 
first anniversary of such date. A staff employee eligible 
for leave under this paragraph shall be remunerated 
because of such sickness or accident in accordance with 

the 
Workers’ Compensation law. 


(2) Not later than seven (7) calendar days after the first day 
he is unable to work because of the disability, a staff 
Page 17 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

employee entitled to leave under paragraph L. 2. b. 1. 
above may elect, in lieu of leave under this paragraph (L. 

2. b. 1.), to use accrued and unused sick leave. If a staff 
employee elects to use leave as provided in the 
paragraph above, such leave must commence as of the 
first day the staff employee is unable to work because of 
the disability and must continue until the staff employee 
returns to work, or the accrued sick leave is exhausted, 
whichever occurs earlier. If a staff employee's accrued 
sick leave is exhausted before he is able to return to 
work, he shall immediately be entitled to commence 
leave under paragraph L. 2. b. 1. above, which shall 
continue to the first anniversary of the date he was first 
unable to work because of such disability. 
3. Exclusions. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, disability benefits under this paragraph 
shall not be available for illness or accident disability resulting from or 
contributed to by war or any act of war, whether declared or undeclared; 
intentionally self-inflicted injury; or injury sustained in the commission of 
or having participated in committing a felony. Eligibility for disability 
benefits will automatically cease upon the date the staff employee 
returns to active duty with Montgomery College; the staff employee's 
seventieth (70th) birthday; the date upon which the staff employee retires 
under a Montgomery College retirement plan; the date on which the staff 
employee's employment with Montgomery College ceases; or the date 
on which the staff employee ceases to be under the care of a legally 
qualified physician; whichever occurs earliest. Short term disability leave 
shall be available only for such period of time during the year the staff 
employee would have been scheduled to perform assigned 
responsibilities in the position which entitles the employee to such 
disability leave. 

4. Reduction of Montgomery College Expenditure. 
If the staff employee qualifies for Workers’ Compensation, Social 


Security or other disability compensation plans to which Montgomery 
College contributes on account of the sickness or accident disability for 
which the staff employee qualifies for benefits under this paragraph, the 
total amount of remuneration received by the staff employee from such 
disability compensation plans plus any additional amounts payable by 
the College pursuant to this paragraph shall not exceed the salary the 
staff employee would have received that is attributable to the period of 
leave under this paragraph. If, during the period of such sickness or 
accident disability, the staff employee engages in any work for wage or 
profit, the remuneration set forth in sections L. 1. or 2. above shall be 
reduced by the amount of the wage or profit during the time period in 
question. 

5. Proof of Disability. 
Upon request of the Office of Human Resources, Development, and 

Page 18 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

Engagement, a staff employee claiming disability benefits under this 
paragraph shall submit to an examination by a qualified physician 
designated by the College. If the physician designated by the College is 
of the opinion that the staff employee is not completely disabled from 
engaging in some or all of the staff employee's responsibilities to 
Montgomery College, the staff employee shall be required to perform 
such duties as the physician designated by the College determines 
appropriate, unless the staff employee's personal physician disagrees 
with the opinion of the physician designated by the College; in which 
event, the physician designated by the College and the staff employee's 
personal physician shall select a third physician to examine the staff 
employee at the College's expense. The majority opinion of the three 
physicians shall prevail. 

6. No Extension of Disability Benefits Program. 
The total amount of short term disability leave available on account of 
any one disability shall not extend for a period in excess of twelve (12) 
months. In the event a staff employee returns to work prior to the 
expiration of such twelve (12) month period and subsequently is unable 
to continue to work because of the original sickness or accident 
disability, the staff employee shall be entitled to receive benefits, in 
accord with the provisions of this paragraph, for the unused balance of 
the original twelve (12) months if the staff employee otherwise qualifies 
under this paragraph. 

7. Leave and Continuous Service Credit. 
A staff employee shall not accrue annual or sick leave during the period 
the staff employee is receiving disability benefits nor shall the period of 
time the staff employee is on disability leave be counted towards 
satisfaction of the required probationary period. 

8. Application for Disability Benefits. 
Application for disability benefits shall be submitted, on a form to be 
provided by the Office of Human Resources, Development, and 
Engagement, to the Office of Human Resources, Development, and 
Engagement. The application shall include the written opinion of a 
legally qualified physician as to the nature and extent of the sickness or 
accident disability, the effective date of such disability, the anticipated 
duration of such disability, and a clear statement that the staff employee 
is unable to perform any of the staff employee's assigned responsibilities 
because of such sickness or accident disability. The Office of Human 
Resources, Development, and Engagement shall establish the effective 
date of disability based on the form so submitted. A staff employee 
whose application for benefits under this paragraph is denied by the 
Office of Human Resources, Development, and Engagement may appeal 
to the Senior Vice President for Administrative and Fiscal Services. 

M. Other Long-Term Leave 
The President may authorize long-term leave with pay for unusual and imperative 

Page 19 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

reasons not covered by any of the foregoing categories of leave. The President 
may authorize, upon recommendation from the appropriate Vice President and 
provost/Senior Vice President, long-term leave without pay for categories of 
leave not covered in the preceding paragraphs pertaining to long-term leave. A 
determination will be made in each case concerning continued participation in the 
retirement and other benefit plans and payments therefore. 

II. Leave Without Pay for Non-Bargaining Administrative, Associate, and Support Staff 
These procedures are applicable to all requests for leave without pay. 

A. General 
1. Leave without pay for one through five consecutive working days may be 
granted to an employee by his/her supervisor. 
2. All other leave without pay in excess of five consecutive working days 
may be granted: (1) in accordance with the provisions of the Federal 
Family and Medical Leave Act, as outlined below, or (2) upon approval 
by the President (for administrators) or by the Vice President of Human 
Resources, Development, and Engagement or designee (for associate 
and support staff) as outlined below. 
3. In all cases of leave without pay in excess of five consecutive working 
days, the employee shall submit a request to the President or designee 
(for administrators) or the Vice President of Human Resources, 
Development, and Engagement or designee (for associate and support 
staff) through normal supervisory channels detailing the reasons for the 
request. 
4. All applications for leave without pay for military service shall be 
accompanied by a copy of the employee's official orders which summon 
the employee to active duty. Military service includes active service as a 
commissioned officer, warrant officer, or enlisted person in the Army, 
Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, or Marine Corps. 
5. Employees shall request leave without pay at least 30 days in advance, 
when the purpose of the leave is foreseeable. 
B. Family and Medical Leave Without Pay 
These procedures are applicable to requests for leave without pay subject to the 
provisions of the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). The 
procedures will be administered in accordance with the provisions of the FMLA. 

1. Eligibility 
Employees are eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave if they have 
worked for the College at least 12 months and for 1,250 hours over the 
previous 12 months. 

2. Reasons for Leave 
Page 20 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

Unpaid leave will be granted for any of the following reasons: 

a. To care for an employee's child after birth, or placement for 
adoption or foster care; 
b. To care for the employee's spouse, son or daughter, or parent 
who has a serious health condition; or 
c. For a “serious health condition” that makes the employee unable 
to perform her/his job. A serious health condition for purposes of 
the FMLA means: 
(1) An illness or injury that involves an overnight stay in a 
health care facility and any subsequent treatment in 
connection with such stay; or, 
(2) Continuing treatment by a health care provider including 
any one or more of the following: 
i. a period of incapacity of more than 3 
consecutive, full calendar days and subsequent 
treatment by a health care provider in-person 
two or more times within 30 days of the first day 
of incapacity 
ii. treatment by a health care provider in-person on 
at least one occasion which results in a regimen 
of continuing treatment 
iii. pregnancy and prenatal care 
iv. condition which requires visits at least twice a 
year for treatment by a health care provider over 
an extended period of time and may cause 
episodic rather than a continuing period of 
incapacity 
v. permanent or long-term conditions 
vi. conditions requiring multiple treatments by a 
health care provider including recovery time 
d. A qualifying exigency which occurs while the employee’s spouse, 
son, daughter, or parent who is a reservist, member of the 
National Guard, or retired member of the Regular Armed Forces 
or Reserves is on federal active duty or has received a federal 
call to active duty in support of a contingency operation. 
A qualifying exigency includes: 

(1) any issue relating to a short-notice deployment (i.e. 
within seven calendar days of notification of 
deployment); 
(2) attendance at military events and related activities, such 
as pre-deployment briefings and family support 
sessions; 
Page 21 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

(3) time needed to provide or arrange for childcare or 
participate in school-related activities with respect to a 
child or ward of the covered family member; 
(4) time needed to make or update financial and legal 
arrangements relating to the covered family member or 
act as the covered family member’s representative with 
respect to military service benefits; 
(5) time needed to participate in counseling, where the 
need for counseling arises from the covered member’s 


active duty or call to active duty; 

(6) up to five days spent with a covered family member on 
short-term rest and recuperation leave from a 
deployment; 
(7) post-deployment activities, including any official 
ceremony sponsored by the military, as well as 
exigencies arising from the death of a covered family 
member while on active duty status; and 
(8) additional activities, provided that the employer and the 
employee agree that such leave shall qualify as an 
exigency and agree as to the timing and the duration of 
such leave. 
e. To care for a “covered service member” injured or 
incurred a 
serious illness in the line 
of duty while on active duty. A “covered 
service member” means a current member of the Armed Forces, 
including a member of the national Guard or Reserves, who has 
a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty on active 
duty that may render the service member medically unfit to 
perform his or her duties for which the service member is 
undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy; or is in 
outpatient status; or is on the temporary disability retired list. An 
employee is eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave in 
a 12 month period for reasons (a)-(d) above. FLMA includes a 
special leave entitlement for reason (e) above, that permits 
eligible employees to take up to 26 weeks of unpaid FMLA leave 
to care for a covered service member during a single 12 month 
period. 

3. Job Benefits and Protection 
a. For the duration of the leave, the College will maintain group 
health care coverage under the same conditions as if the 
employee were still working. 
b. Employees are entitled to return to their former job or an 
equivalent position at the end of the leave, except as provided 
for under the FMLA. 
c. The use of leave under these procedures will not result in the 
loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the start of 
an employee's leave. 
Page 22 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

4. Certification 
The College will require certification for FLMA leave. The employee must 
respond to such a request within fifteen (15) days of the request or 
provide a reasonable explanation for the delay. Failure to provide 
certification may result in a denial of continuation of leave. 
To Qualify for Unpaid FMLA Leave: 

a. Medical certification will be provided using the DOL Certification 
of Health Care Provider for 
Employee’s 
Serious Health Condition 


Form. 

b. Military family leave certification will be provided using the DOL 
Certification of Qualifying Exigency For Military Family Leave 
Form or DOL Certification for Serious Injury or Illness of Covered 
Service Member for Military Leave Form. 
C. Other Leave Without Pay 
These procedures are applicable to all requests for leave without pay over five 
days except those covered by the FMLA. 

1. Eligibility 
Administrative, Associate, and Support Staff with regular status may 
request leave without pay for a period of time not to exceed 12 months. 

2. Reinstatement Rights 
a. An eligible employee who has completed three or more 
consecutive years of satisfactory service to the College and who 
has been granted leave without pay under this section shall have 
the right of reinstatement in his or her former position upon 
return from such leave unless the employee waived such right 
prior to the expiration of such leave. 
b. An eligible employee who has completed less than three years of 
satisfactory service to the College and who has been granted 
leave without pay for a period no greater than three months shall 
have the right of reinstatement in his or her former position upon 
return from such leave unless the employee waived such right 
prior to the expiration of such leave. 
c. In all cases where reinstatement rights do not apply, the College 
will make every attempt to place the employee in a position 
comparable to the one previously held. If such placement is not 
achieved by the end of six months from the end of the period of 
leave without pay, the employee will be separated from the 
service of the College in good standing. 
3. Reinstatement Procedures After a Period of Leave Without Pay 
a. An employee who has been on leave without pay for a period of 
not more than three months shall notify the President or 
Page 23 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

designee (if an administrator) or the Vice President of Human 
Resources, Development, and Engagement or designee (if other 
staff) no later than two weeks before the end of the leave period 
of his or her intention to return to duty. 
b. An employee who has been on leave without pay for a period in 
excess of three months shall notify the Director of Personnel 
Management no later than 30 calendar days before the end of 
the leave period of his or her intention to return to duty. 
c. An employee with reinstatement rights shall be reinstated in the 
former position, assuming the individual is still qualified to 
perform the duties of said position and assuming that the 
position has not been abolished or reclassified and assuming 
that the employer has timely notified the College of his/her intent 
to return. The President for administrators or the Vice President 
of Human Resources, Development, and Engagement or 
designee for staff employees shall have the responsibility for 
determining the returning employee's fitness for resuming the 
responsibilities of his or her former position. 
d. If the returning employee's former position no longer exists or 
has been reclassified, the employee shall be given preferential 
consideration for any other comparable vacant position; or, if 
qualified, he/she shall be placed in the reclassified former 
position. 
e. If the returning employee's experience while on leave has 
resulted in qualifying him/her for a higher level position than the 
previously held position, the employee may apply for any other 
vacant position for which he/she is now qualified, instead of 
automatic reinstatement in the formerly held position. 
f. An employee on leave without pay for military service shall 
surrender all reinstatement rights if, after completing the initial 
period of military service, he/she voluntarily elects to remain in 
the military service; or, after being discharged subsequently 
decides to re-enlist voluntarily. An employee shall not be eligible 
to be granted leave without pay for military service or to be 
continued on such leave for such voluntary service beyond the 
initial period of service. 
g. An employee returning from leave without pay who does not 
accept reinstatement to his/her former position or to a 
comparable or better position shall thereby surrender all 
reinstatement rights. 
h. An employee returning from military leave who does not accept 
reinstatement to his/her former position or to a comparable or 
better position within 90 days after the offer of reinstatement is 
made shall thereby surrender all reinstatement rights. 
i. In cases where the employee who has been on leave without 

Page 24 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

pay does not have reinstatement rights, the Human Resources 
Office shall make an effort to place the returning employee in a 
position comparable to the formerly held position within six 
months. 

4. Benefits During Leave Without Pay 
a. An employee on leave without pay, except when such leave is 
granted for military service, may continue participation in the 
employee benefit plan. 
b. During the employee's period of leave, the amount for benefits 
normally contributed by the employee and the amount for 
benefits normally contributed by the College shall both be paid 
by the employee. 
c. If payments are not made by the employee by the due dates 
specified in the contractual agreement, participation in the 
benefit plans will be discontinued. 
d. As a result of each period of leave without pay in excess of 60 
calendar days (except for self-improvement, disability, and 
military service), the employee's annual salary increment date 
and adjusted date of employment shall be moved forward the 
same number of days as the employee was on leave without pay 
in excess of 60 calendar days. 
D. Leave Without Pay for Professional Improvement/Self-Improvement 
An administrative, associate, or support staff employee who has completed three 
consecutive years of service with the College may be granted leave without pay 
for professional improvement or self-improvement by the President (or designee) 
for administrators and the Vice President of Human Resources, Development, 
and Engagement (or designee) for associate and support staff employees. The 
College may pay the total cost (including the amount usually paid by the 
employee) of the employee's continued participation in the employee benefit 
(retirement, health and life insurance) plan upon the employee's satisfactorily 
meeting the following standards. 

1. The content of the planned course of study or vocational training 
program is directly applicable to the work performed by the employee for 
the College and will be of immediate benefit to both the employee and 
the College upon the employee's return from leave, or, it will prepare the 
employee for a different role at the College that is mutually agreed upon 
in advance and identified as an actual, funded need of the College. In the 
latter case the planned course of study must be sufficient to enable the 
employee to meet fully the required qualifications for the new position. 
The course or program content must be applicable and clearly 
established by the materials presented to support the recommendation. 
2. The course of study is either a terminal program; a self contained, 
independent unit; or the final phase of a degree or other long term 
program; and can be completed within the maximum period of time (12 
Page 25 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

months) allowable for this kind of leave. 

3. The course of study will be undertaken at an institution or organization 
which has appropriate accreditation, professional reputation or status in 
the field being studied. In the event of doubt on this point the opinion of 
a recognized expert in the field will be obtained by the College to 
consider the selection. 
4. The course of study is full-time, and the employee provides a written 
certification to the effect that during this leave he or she will not engage 
in other employment which might jeopardize the obtaining of maximum 
benefit from the study. In addition, the employee documents the fact that 
he or she will not receive from a scholarship, grant, or salary (either 
singly or combined) an amount greater than the salary regularly received 
from Montgomery College less the amount regularly contributed to the 
cost of participation in the retirement, health and life insurance plans by 
the employee. All allowances over and above the grant, scholarship, or 
other compensation, which are awarded specifically for necessary 
related purposes such as housing, traveling, and moving expenses, are 
to be identified but not counted in this income comparison. 
III. Leaves For Bargaining Unit Staff 
These procedures pertain to employees in positions represented by AFSCME Local 
2380. See the current collective bargaining agreement for leave provisions. 

A. Requests for sick leave, annual leave, bereavement leave, personal leave, short-

Page 28 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

f. 

g. 

2. Criteria 
a. 
Faculty members on sabbatical leave shall not accept 
employment or other commitments external to the College while 
on sabbatical leave. A faculty member may request the Vice 
President of Human Resources, Development, and Engagement 
to approve employment which does not interfere with carrying 
out the objectives of the sabbatical leave. 

Faculty members shall notify the Vice President of Human 
Resources, Development, and Engagement as soon as possible 
if, for any reason, they are unable to complete the program or 
meet the objectives for which the sabbatical leave was granted. 
The Vice President of Human Resources, Development, and 
Engagement shall determine the appropriate action to take in 
such circumstances, including termination of the leave, 
assignment to another leave category, reassignment to regular 
full-time duties, and/or reimbursement to the College for any 
monies due to the College as a result of a change in leave 
status. 

All requests for sabbatical leave are evaluated for consistency 
with the approved goals and objectives of the department/unit, 
campus, and College, and with respect to the manner in which 
the program to be undertaken will benefit the College, the 
students, and the professional development of the individual. 
Examples of the type of activities that may meet the overall 
criteria are as follows: 

(1) To carry on a program of purposeful course work for a 
period of at least one semester, or to attend a 
semester-long institute. 
(2) To complete a book or other scholarly work that is of 
value to the individual and the academic community. 
(3) To participate in research or an operational project of at 
least a semester's duration or more which would result in 
improvement in the applicant's overall competency for 
responsibilities at the College. 
(4) To take part in some organized community project 
designed to improve relations between the College and 
the community. 
(5) To travel provided such travel has a direct bearing on 
the particular subject matter field or educational 
methodology of the instructor. 
Other considerations may also be taken into account by the 
President. For example: 

(1) Contributions which the applicant has made over the 
b. 

Page 29 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

years to the College. 

(2) Previous sabbatical leave or comparable leave granted 
previously to the applicant. 
(3) Length of service of the applicant at Montgomery 
College. 
3. Sabbatical Leave Committee 
a. Purpose 
The purpose of this procedure is to set forth the operational 
process for requesting, reviewing, and awarding faculty 
sabbatical leaves. The procedure also provides a mechanism to 
enable faculty representatives to advise the President (or 
designee) with respect to the selection of faculty members for 
the award of sabbatical leaves. 

b. Responsibilities 
(1) Sabbatical leaves are approved by the President (or 
designee). 
(2) The President has delegated to the Vice President of 
Human Resources, Development, and Engagement the 
responsibility and accountability for implementing this 
college-wide procedure. 
c. Sabbatical Leave Committee 
(1) The functions of the committee are to evaluate 
applications for faculty sabbatical leaves and to advise 
the President with respect to the selection of faculty 
members for the award of sabbatical leaves. The 
President may also ask the committee to review 
completed sabbatical leave reports. 
(2) The committee is composed of six faculty members, two 
from each campus, appointed by the Faculty Assembly. 
Members serve two-year staggered terms. The 
Assembly shall notify the Vice President of Human 
Resources, Development, and Engagement of the 
membership of the committee upon appointment. 
d. Procedure 
(1) During the fall semester of the academic year 
immediately preceding the academic year in which 
leaves may begin, the Vice President of Human 
Resources, Development, and Engagement or designee 
will meet with the committee to discuss the published 
criteria, the priorities for the forthcoming academic year, 
Page 30 of 35 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College -Montgomery College 35003CP 

the review process, and the method by which 
applications are recommended. 

(2) Sabbatical leave applications will be available beginning 
each August. An optional information session if offered 
during professional week to review the process and 
answer questions. 
(3) The completed application for sabbatical leave, which 
shall include a statement of the objectives to be 
accomplished during the leave, shall be submitted 
through normal administrative channels to the Vice 
President of Human Resources, Development, and

PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 
Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 020 
Subject: Performance Evaluation and Employee Development 

I. Evaluation of Administrators 
All administrators will be evaluated on an annual basis, with evaluations completed no 
later than June 30 of each year. Performance evaluations are an integral part of 
performance management. The Office of Human Resources, Development, and 
Engagement will provide instruction and training to all administrators concerning the 

performance evaluation process. Administrators 
will receive an overall rating of: “Far 
Exceeds Expectations,” “Exceeds Expectations,” “Meets Expectations,” “Needs Some 
Improvement,” or “Does Not Meet Expectations.” 
Such overall rating, subject to 
additional criteria determined by the president, will be based on the ratings received in 
regard to: 1) overall performance of duties and responsibilities as described on the 
administrator’s position 
description; 2) administrator competencies; and 3) 
achievement 
of the annual goals/objectives established by the administrator’s supervisor. 

II. Evaluation of Associate and Support Staff 
A. The Office of Human Resources, Development, and Engagement will administer 
a performance evaluation system for associate and support staff (including 
temporary with benefits staff) as an integral part of the College's personnel 
management program. 
All staff will be evaluated on an annual basis, with evaluations completed no later 
than August 21 of each year. The Office of Human Resources, Development, 
and Engagement will provide instruction and training to all administrators 
concerning the performance evaluation process. Staff will receive an overall 

rating of: “Far Exceeds 
Expectations,” “Exceeds Expectations,” “Meets 
Expectations,” “Needs 
Some Improvement,” or “Does 
Not Meet Expectations.” 


Such overall rating, subject to additional criteria determined by the president, will 
be based on the ratings received in regard to: 1) overall performance of duties 
and responsibilities as described on the staff member’s position description; 2) 
staff competencies; and 3) achievement of the annual goals/objectives 

established by the staff 
member’s supervisor. 


B. Procedures 
1. Notification. The Vice President of Human Resources, Development and 
Engagement shall notify the employee's supervisor of the deadline for all 
required evaluations. The notification will indicate the purpose of the 
evaluation, i.e., employee development, the granting of regular status, 
annual performance, review prior to promotion, etc., and will provide the 
supervisor with the evaluation form to be used in documenting the 
process. 
2. Orientation Conference. At the beginning of the employee's service, the 
immediate supervisor shall hold a conference to orient the employee to 
his or her new work assignment and to explain when, how, and why the 
employee is to be evaluated. Standards of work shall be used as a basis 
Page 1 of 15 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 

for discussion. The current position description, class specification and 
unit goals should serve as a basis throughout such a conference. 

3. Coaching Conversation. When there is evidence that an employee will 
need to improve before he or she is given regular status, before a salary 
increment will be recommended, or before other action will be taken, 
several coaching conversations should be held. The supervisor should 
make a written record of each conversation, and a copy should be given 
to the employee. At these times, the employee shall be given specific 
suggestions for continued improvement in his or her job performance. 
4. Evaluation Conference. Evaluation conferences should be scheduled so 
that the employee will be given advance notice of the appointed time. 
The employee and the immediate supervisor will participate in the 
evaluation conference. The evaluator should take this opportunity to 
discuss areas of strengths and areas needing improvements, and to 
identify changes that may need to be made in the employee's position 
description. 
5. Non-Concurrence. If the employee does not concur with the evaluation, 
he or she should sign the evaluation form for the purpose of indicating 
participation in the evaluation conference, noting his or her 
non-concurrence, and attach the comments to the evaluation form. 
Employee disagreements concerning his or her performance evaluation 
may be appealed to higher supervisory levels but cannot be the basis for 
a formal grievance. 
6. Administrator Review. The appropriate administrator will review and sign 
evaluations for employees assigned to offices under his or her 
supervision. In all cases where the employee disagrees with the 
evaluation and where a negative recommendation results, the 
appropriate administrator will review the matter with the evaluating 
supervisor in sufficient detail to reach an informed decision, and will 
prepare a separate statement of concurrence or disagreement with the 
recommendation and forward the complete evaluation package to the 
Vice President of Human Resources, Development, and Engagement. 
III. Evaluation of Full-time Faculty 
A. Purposes 
1. To promote the highest quality instruction (teaching/learning). 
2. To encourage the highest quality performance by faculty. 
3. To encourage professional growth and development of faculty. 
4. To assess strengths and weaknesses in faculty performance. 
B. General 
1. Student evaluations of all full-time instructional faculty will be conducted 
each academic year. A minimum of two different sections (preferably 
Page 2 of 15 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 

different courses) will be evaluated. The College will identify and provide 
an instrument for the student evaluation to all instructional faculty. The 
faculty member may also administer a student evaluation instrument of 
his/her choice in addition to the standardized instrument and include the 
results in his/her self-evaluation. 

2. All evaluation materials will be handled in a confidential manner. The 
administrative summary prepared as part of a comprehensive evaluation 
will be placed in the faculty member's personnel file. Other materials 
compiled as part of the evaluation (student and peer evaluations, etc.) 
will be maintained in the office of the appropriate Dean or Provost. 
C. Comprehensive Evaluation 
1. General 
a. A comprehensive evaluation includes student evaluations, a self-
evaluation, a peer review, classroom observations, a 
departmental chair review, and a Dean summary evaluation. 
b. For new faculty members, the comprehensive evaluation during 
the first year of employment will focus on faculty performance 
during the first semester of employment. For other faculty 
members, a comprehensive evaluation will focus on faculty 
performance since the last evaluation. 
c. Notwithstanding the schedule below, a faculty member will be 
required to undergo a comprehensive evaluation during any 
academic year if such evaluation is determined necessary by the 
appropriate Dean. 
2. Schedule

dean’s discretion. 


D. Standards of Performance 
1. Evaluative Criteria 
All evaluators will focus on and address each of the following evaluative 
criteria in all evaluations: 

Page 3 of 15 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 

a. Faculty members shall demonstrate at least satisfactory 
performance in the teaching/primary assignment, which includes 
currency in primary subject/assignment area. 
b. Faculty members shall demonstrate professional growth in 
teaching/assignment area and pedagogy/service techniques. 
c. Faculty members shall demonstrate substantial progress in 
meeting special objectives from preceding evaluation cycle(s). 
d. Faculty members shall demonstrate professional service to 
campus and/or College and/or community. 
2. Elements 
Each of these is of critical importance. Applied as appropriate, they 
represent a definition of expectation for faculty members. Serious 
shortcomings in any of these categories must be addressed promptly 
with carefully developed steps cited to effect improvement. Failure to 
make improvement incurs the possibility of an unsatisfactory 
performance rating. Further, it should be noted that, although the 
comprehensive evaluation takes place in one semester, the process of 
evaluation continues from one evaluation to another, so that the 
obligation to perform faculty duties remains and is ongoing. Finally, 
while all elements are important in assessing faculty performance, and 
while the responsibilities of faculty members as noted elsewhere in the 
Policies/Procedure Manual must be considered, peers and 
administrators will give greatest weight to those elements associated 
with the faculty member's primary assignment; i.e., teaching or a specific 
counselor function. 

Faculty members will be evaluated considering the following elements: 

a. Instructional Faculty 
(1) Teaching materials, including syllabi (which must 
conform to the Montgomery College Syllabus Template 
as outlined in the Montgomery College Faculty 
Handbook) 
(2) Teaching techniques 
(3) Instructor knowledge of subject matter 
(4) Availability to students 
b. Counseling Faculty 
(1) Availability to students 
(2) Knowledge of counseling theories and techniques 
(personal and career) 
(3) Teaching techniques and materials. 
Page 4 of 15 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 

(4) Academic (advising and transfer) and career counseling 
(5) Resource role to teaching faculty 
c. All Faculty (as applicable) 
(1) Individual and unit responsibilities 
(2) Advising (academic and/or activity) responsibilities 
(3) Other responsibilities and activities, such as curriculum 
development, textbook review and selection, outreach 
activities, and program accreditation 
(4) Interpersonal relations 
(5) Professional growth and development 
(6) Professional contributions and achievement 
(7) Service to students and college and, as appropriate, 
community 
(8) Progress on individual annual objectives 
(9) Submission of non-instructional assessment data 
(College Area Review [CAR] and Outcomes Assessment 
[OA]) in accordance with established deadlines 
(10) Timely submission of student grades and participation in 
assessment practices. 
E. Process 
1. Upon the request of any party, the Dean (or Associate Dean) or the 
department chair/coordinator, and faculty member being evaluated will 
discuss each component, the schedule, and the process. 
2. The components of the faculty performance review include the following: 
a. Student Evaluations 
b. Self Evaluation (Form A submitted to the peer review committee) 
c. Classroom Observation (Form B) 
d. Peer Review (Form C) 
e. Department Chair Review (Form D submitted directly to the 
Dean) 
f. Dean Summary Evaluation (Form E) 
3. Faculty member and department chair/coordinator shall select a peer 
review committee of 2-3 faculty members from within the same academic 
department or discipline. A department committee may be established 
but the faculty member being evaluated is under no obligation to use it 
and may select his/her own committee with the department 
Page 5 of 15 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 

chair/coordinator. One committee member shall be designated as the 
Lead Peer Reviewer. The committee will compile the results of the peer 
review and the Lead Peer Reviewer will discuss the results with the 
faculty member and provide a copy of the completed Peer Review Form 
to the faculty member and the Dean per number 6 below. 

4. Classroom observations (minimum of three) are conducted in 
accordance with a predetermined schedule. Two members of the Peer 
Review Committee and the Dean (or Associate Dean) will serve as 
Classroom Observers. The two Peer Review Committee members and 
the Dean (or Associate Dean) will each complete the Classroom 
Observation Form and discuss his/her individual observations with the 
faculty member and provide copies to the faculty member and to the 
Dean per number 6 below. 
5. The department chair will complete the Chair’s Review, discuss the 
results with the faculty member, and provide a copy to the faculty 
member and to the Dean. In the event of the evaluation of the 
department chair, one of the faculty members on the peer review 
committee will assume the responsibilities of the department chair in the 
evaluation process with respect to selecting the peer review committee 
(where no department committee has been established) and completing 
the Chair’s Review. 

6. When the performance review packet is complete (self-evaluation, 
classroom observations and peer review), the department chair or Lead 
Peer Reviewer is responsible for delivering the packet to the Dean 
according to the established deadlines 
7. Dean will review all information including the student evaluations, the self 
evaluation, classroom observations, peer evaluation, and department 
chair’s checklist, complete a Dean Summary Evaluation, and hold a 
conference with the faculty member to discuss the summary. The final 
"Summary Evaluation" will include a performance rating of "satisfactory" 
or "unsatisfactory" reflecting the Dean's overall assessment of the faculty 
member's professional performance; a plan of activities tied to the 
professional development of the faculty member and, if appropriate, a 
plan to address specific areas requiring improvement. The form is 
placed in the faculty member's personnel file, with a copy to the faculty 
member, chair, and Provost. 
F. Appeal of Performance Rating Process 
A faculty member who receives a performance rating of "unsatisfactory" may 
appeal the process that led to the rating in accordance with the steps below. 

1. The faculty member must appeal the rating to the campus Provost, in 
writing, within five (5) working days of receipt of the rating. The Provost 
will acknowledge receipt of the request, in writing, within five (5) working 
days of receipt of the written appeal. 
2. The provost will take the following action with respect to the appeal: 
review the process which led to the rating and render a decision 
regarding it to the faculty member, in writing, within ten (10) working days 
Page 6 of 15 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 

of acknowledging receipt of the appeal. As part of that review, the 
provost will establish a review committee consisting of one administrator 
appointed by the Provost and one faculty member appointed by the 
Faculty Council1, within three (3) working days, to review the rating 
process which led to the unsatisfactory rating. The review committee will 
use the following guidelines to conduct their review. 

a. They will review the materials related to the process used to 
assess each component of the appellant's performance, i.e. 
student evaluation, peer evaluation, self-evaluation and Dean's 
evaluation. 
b. They may review materials that the appellant faculty member 
furnishes them via the Provost, which the faculty member 
believes are pertinent to the appeal of the evaluation process. 
c. The reviewers may interview the appellant faculty member and 
the Dean. 
d. The reviewers will each complete his/her review and each submit 
a written report to the Provost within five (5) working days. The 
reports will include specific findings with respect to the process 
or the manner in which the evaluation procedures were applied 
to the faculty member. The Provost will send a copy of the 
reports to the Dean, faculty member, and department chair. 
e. Within five (5) working days of receipt of the reports of the 
reviewers, the Provost will notify the faculty member in writing of 
his or her final decision. 
IV. Employee Development 
A program of employee development is available to all of the College's employees. The 
program includes: an orientation for those who are newly employed; self-development by 
the individual employee through such benefits as Tuition Waiver and the Educational 
Assistance Program; group programs using College personnel; enrichment opportunities; 
and joint or cooperative presentations involving the use of consultants or personnel of 
other groups, institutions or agencies. 

A. Orientation of New Employees 
New employees will be given a general orientation by the Office of Human 
Resources, Development, and Engagement, or designee, when the new 
employee reports for work. Orientation subjects will include personnel policies, 
salary arrangements, benefits, and general conditions of employment. Those 
topics should then be followed by a discussion of such subjects as history of the 
College, its organization, and the functional relationships of the key offices of the 
College by the new employee's supervisor. In addition, the supervisor for all new 
administrators will assure that the new employee visits all campuses of the 
College and is introduced to other key officials. 

As defined by the new governance structure effective May 2012.

D. Scholarly Activities Program 
1. General 
a. There is a close and important relationship between scholarship 
and teaching. In fact, scholarship is essential to quality 
instruction at a comprehensive community college. Scholarly 
work is expected as part of the normal effort of Montgomery 
College faculty, and for that reason it is important for 
Montgomery College to encourage and support scholarship 
among the faculty within the context of its overall efforts to 
encourage faculty professional development and within available 
resources. 
b. For purposes of this procedure, "scholarship" is defined as the 
"...organization, criticism and interpretation of facts and thoughts 
about facts..."* Accordingly, scholarship is much broader than 
basic research alone, although the two activities are closely 
related. In a community college setting, scholarship also 
extends to a range of discipline-related activities which support 
and supplement effective teaching. (*W.H. Cowley, "Toward 
Harmonizing the Conflicting Points of View About the Ph.D. 
Curriculum for Preparing College Teachers," in Toward Better 
College Teaching, by Fred J. Kelley, U.S. Office of Education, 
Bulletin l950, No. l3, pp. l7-22.) 
c. Examples of discipline-related, scholarly activities are provided 
below. This is not an all-inclusive list. Other reasonable 
requests will be considered. 
(1) To conduct or complete the basic research and writing 
for a scholarly paper or publication. 
(2) To prepare or complete a work of scholarly synthesis or 
opinion. 
(3) To participate in a performing arts activity, such as 
directing a professional community play or conducting an 
orchestra. 
(4) To create or complete an artistic work, such as a 
painting or a musical composition. 
(5) To perform discipline-related work in a public or private 
Page 9 of 15 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 

setting as a non-paid consultant or intern. 

(6) To hold a major office in a discipline-related local, state, 
or national professional organization. 
(7) To develop knowledge of state of the art developments 
in the technologies areas by performing non-paid work in 
a public or private setting. 
(8) To update teaching and/or professional competence 
through the reading of an extensive bibliography of 
works at the cutting edge of the discipline, as part of a 
pre-planned program. 
d. In this procedure, references to instructional deans shall be 
interpreted to encompass campus Deans of Student 
Development and campus Directors of Educational Support 
Services. References to provosts shall encompass the Director 
of Educational Support Services. 
2. Responsibilities 
The scholarly activities program is administered on the campus level by 
the Instructional Deans. 

3. Eligibility 
Full-time faculty members are eligible to apply for participation in the 
program after they have been employed full-time at the College for at 
least three full academic years. When all other considerations are the 
same, more senior faculty will be given first priority. 

4. Procedure 
a. Eligible instructional faculty may apply for up to 3 ESH alternate 
time in a semester, once every four academic years, or 4 ESH 
every five years, or 5 ESH every six years, to participate in a 
program of scholarly activity. Non-instructional faculty may 
request up to 8 hours per week alternate time in a semester, 
once every four academic years; or 11 hours per week every five 
years, or 13 hours per week every six years. Alternately, non-
instructional faculty may request up to 15 consecutive days in a 
semester, once every four academic years, or 17 days every five 
years, or 20 days every six years. 
b. Faculty shall apply to participate in the program directly to the 
appropriate Instructional Dean. The request, in the form of a 
memorandum, shall include a description of the activity to be 
undertaken and an indication of how the activity fits into the 
faculty member's overall program of professional development. 
The memorandum will also include the semester (fall or spring) 
that the faculty member would like to participate and the amount 
of alternate time requested (up to 3 ESH). 
Page 10 of 15 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 

c. Faculty will be asked to make requests well in advance in order 
to assure that classes can be scheduled properly and conflicts 
avoided. 
d. In reviewing proposals, Instructional Deans will take into account 
the need to schedule and staff course offerings, full-time/parttime 
faculty ratios, and similar considerations. If requests are 
denied because of such considerations, the Dean will endeavor 
to give the faculty member priority in a subsequent semester. 
Alternate time will not be approved for any activity for which the 
faculty member receives a salary or similar payment. 
5. Faculty Responsibilities 
a. At the conclusion of the semester in which a faculty member 
participates in the program, a report of the activities undertaken 
will be forwarded to the Instructional Dean. The report may be a 
written one, but it is more desirable if it takes the form of a 
formal or informal presentation to other Montgomery College 
faculty, a performance or show of artistic work, or some other 
activity which serves to share and disseminate the knowledge 
gained from the program among faculty, staff, and students at 
the College. 
b. Written reports will be submitted to the Dean within 60 days of 
the completion of the semester in which the activities took place. 
Formal or informal presentations will take place during the 
semester following the semester in which the activities were 
undertaken. 
E. ITI Enhancement Program 
1. Overview 
The Information Technology Institute (ITI) Enhancement Program 
provides full-time faculty members in information technology academic 
areas or disciplines (e.g. CA/CS/ITI) an opportunity to pursue 
professional development in new technologies during the fall or spring 
semester. Selected faculty members will be awarded up to 15 ESH 
assigned time during the semester in which they participate. All full-time 
faculty members in information technology disciplines are eligible to 
apply for this professional development program. 

2. Application Process 
a. Each spring, eligible faculty members will be offered an 
opportunity to participate in the program during the following fall 
and spring semesters. The detailed announcement will include 
the number of awards available and information regarding the 
areas of priority need in which applications will be accepted. The 
announcement is normally distributed by February 15. 
b. Applicants must complete an application form describing the 
Page 11 of 15 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 

training and other activities they would undertake if selected for 
the ITI Enhancement Program, expected outcomes, and other 
information, and must submit the form by the designated 
deadline date. The normal deadline date is no later than April 
15. 

3. Responsibilities 
a. The Director of the Information Technology Institute is 
responsible for administering the ITI Enhancement Program. 
The Director is assisted by an ITI Leadership Group in selecting 
priority areas of College need, reviewing applications, and 
interviewing candidates. The final decision regarding faculty 
selections is made by the Director of the Information Technology 
Institute, who will consult with the appropriate Dean before 
making the final decision. 
b. The Director will notify the Vice President of Human Resources, 
Development and Engagement, as well as the appropriate Dean 
and chair, of the faculty members selected for the program, and 
will identify the specific faculty positions previously established 
for any necessary faculty replacements. 
4. Obligations 
a. Faculty recipients agree to devote assigned time to the purpose 
of the program during the period of participation; to complete a 
report describing accomplishments during the period of 
participation within 30 days of completion of program 
participation; and to remain in the employment of the College for 
up to two years following the completion of the program. 
b. If the faculty recipient fails to meet the full employment obligation 
for the period required, the faculty member shall reimburse the 
College for monies paid to the faculty member, or on the faculty 
member’s behalf, while the 
faculty member was 
a participant in 


the ITI Enhancement Program. The reimbursable amount due is 
pro-rated to reflect the amount of ESH awarded to the faculty 
member and the length of time that the faculty member remained 
employed at the College after the program was completed. 

V. Evaluation of Part-Time Faculty 
A. Purposes 
Regular evaluation is important for both the part-time faculty member and for the 
discipline/department for the following reasons: 

1. to promote the highest quality instruction, counseling, and/or advising 
and encourage the highest quality performance by the part-time faculty 
member; 
2. to provide feedback to the part-time faculty member on his/her teaching, 
counseling, and/or advising regarding strengths and possible areas 
Page 12 of 15 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 

needing attention or improvement; 

3. to confirm that discipline and course outcomes are met and ensure that 
quality instruction is offered to students; and 
4. to provide the part-time faculty member with information regarding 
mentoring and/or professional development. 
B. General 
This collegewide plan establishes the minimum for evaluation of part-time faculty. 
However, the department may observe and evaluate a faculty member more 
frequently. 

C. Frequency 
Part-time faculty will be evaluated at the following times. 

1. During the first semester of teaching, counseling or advising and during 
the first assignment to an additional course, the part-time faculty will be 
observed by a full-time faculty member in the department. Observation 
should be done early in the semester (preferably before midterm to allow 
for mentoring/intervention, if needed). In some instances, a second 
observation may be scheduled. The observer will share his/her 
observation promptly with the part-time faculty member following the 
observation. 
2. Part-time faculty will be observed at least once every three years. With 
the exception of the first semester of employment, class observations will 
be completed by the time 80% of the course has been completed (e.g., 
in 15-week courses, this would be the twelfth week of the semester). 
3. More frequent observations may be required by the department chair or 
the Dean. 
4. Part-time faculty may request to be observed more frequently than 
required by this section. 
D. Process 
1. Upon the request of any party, the Dean (or Associate Dean) or the 
department chair/coordinator, and faculty member being evaluated will 
discuss each component, the schedule, and the process. 
2. The part-time evaluation and observation forms will be made available to 
the part-time faculty member early in the semester of the evaluation. A 
faculty observer, who is full-time, will be assigned by the department 
chair or course group/discipline coordinator early in the semester. The 
part-time faculty member may request an additional observer from 
among the full-time faculty, subject to approval by the Dean. The signed 
observation form is to be submitted to the department chair and then to 
the Dean, who places it in the part-time faculty member’s personnel file. 
Page 13 of 15 


PROCEDURE -Montgomery College 36001CP 

3. The components of the part-time faculty performance review include the 
following: 
a. Classroom or Advising/Counseling Observation of Part-time 
Professor Form 
b. Student evaluations 
c. Summary Form for Part-Time Faculty Comprehensive Evaluation 
(used only during comprehensive evaluation; see below) 
4. Following a classroom observation, the observer will confer with the part-
time faculty member to discuss the review. The signed classroom 
observation form is to be submitted to the department chair and then to 
the Dean, who places it in the part-time faculty member’s personnel file. 
5. Student evaluations will be conducted regularly. 
6. The classroom observation, including plans for improvement, and 
student evaluation information are to be kept in the part-time faculty 
member’s personnel file. 
E. Comprehensive Evaluation 
1. The part-time faculty member will undergo a comprehensive evaluation 
every three years or prior to a request for advancement in rank (or more 
often, at the discretion of the department chair or Dean). The 
comprehensive evaluation consists of a review of the following: 
a. current and previous classroom observations, completed since 
the most recent comprehensive evaluation; 
b. current and previous student evaluation information, completed 
since the most recent comprehensive evaluation; 
c. instructional materials on file (e.g., syllabi, handouts, tests, 
assignments); 
d. any non-instructional activities assigned since the most recent 
comprehensive evaluation; and 
e. any other materials the part-time faculty member chooses to 
submit. 
2. A summary evaluation statement will be written by the departmental 
representative who is conducting the evaluation using the Summary 
Evaluation Form for Part-Time Faculty Comprehensive Evaluation. 
3. The summary will be shared with the part-time faculty member being 
evaluated. The signed summary evaluation statement form is to be 
submitted to the department chair and then to the Dean, who places it in 
the part-time faculty member’s personnel file.

Chapter: Personnel Modification No. 008 
Subject: Recognition Awards 

I. Purpose 
The purpose of recognition awards is to recognize exceptional, outstanding, 
distinguished, sustained, or special service to the College, the academic profession, the 
County, the State, or the nation by individuals or groups. 

II. Awards 
The following awards are authorized by the Board of Trustees: 

A. Gold Medallion 
This award recognizes exceptional service and nationally recognized presidential 
leadership in higher education. A retiring College President may be 
recommended for this award. Where criteria for award are met, medallions may 
be awarded posthumously. The award is approved by Board of Trustees' 
resolution. 

Criteria 

The award of a Gold Medallion shall be made after intensive review of the 
recommendation in order to ensure that only truly exceptional leadership and 
dedication is recognized and that rigorous criteria have been applied and 
satisfied. In addition, there must be specific acts of documented, exceptional 
service which have been generally recognized as placing the individual in a 
category well above others who have rendered sustained outstanding or 
distinguished service. Consideration will be given to the length of time which the 
individual has devoted to College service, but the exceptional quality of the 
service remains the most important criteria. 

B. Silver Medallion 
This award recognizes outstanding service to the College, the academic 
profession, the County, the State, or the nation. Departing members of the 
Board of Trustees, retiring College faculty, administrators and staff, and friends of 
the College may be recommended for this award. Where criteria for award are 
met, medallions may be awarded posthumously. The award is approved by 
Board of Trustees' resolution. 

Criteria

appropriate steps to investigate. The College will take appropriate action, up to and 
including discharge, against any employee or student who violates this policy. 
IV. Reports of retaliation will be kept confidential except to the extent that limited 
disclosure may be necessary for the purpose of conducting a full and fair investigation, 
providing opportunity for the subject to respond, taking remedial action, and 
responding to a government inquiry or legal action.

part of an investigation that the individual knows is false, files a bad faith retaliation 
claim or participates in any illegal conduct. Such conduct may subject the employee or
